# The Tyranny of Metrics, by Muller

[The Tyranny of Metrics][] is the book version of the author's
[earlier article][]. It's a pretty good [collection][] of [concerns][]
around measurement, focused on [unintended consequences][].

One thing that [Muller][]'s historical perspective brought out was the
development of [scientific management][] and [management consulting][]
as practices distinct from particular fields or businesses. I think
there are parallels to the development of data science.

He also maintains that the main value of a metric can come from
looking at outliers rather than tracking averages or otherwise using
the metric over all cases. I think this is an often neglected focus.


There's a lot of interesting stuff. Here are some quotes that I
thought were particularly interesting:


---

> "Accountability ought to mean being held responsible for one's
> actions. But by a sort of linguistic sleight of hand, accountability
> has come to mean demonstrating success through standardized
> measurement, as if only that which can be counted really counts."
> (page 4)


---

> "When proponents of metrics advocate "accountability," they tacitly
> combine two meanings of the word. On the one hand, to be accountable
> means to be responsible. But it can also mean "capable of being
> counted."" (page 17)


---

> "This book is not about the evils of measuring. It is about the
> unintended consequences of trying to substitute standardized
> measures of performance for personal judgment based on experience.
> The problem is not measurement, but excessive measurement and
> inappropriate measurement—not metrics, but metric fixation." (page
> 4)


---

> "The key components of metric fixation are
>
> * "the belief that it is possible and desirable to replace judgment,
>   acquired by personal experience and talent, with numerical
>   indicators of comparative performance based upon standardized data
>   (metrics);
> * "the belief that making such metrics public (transparent) assures
>   that institutions are actually carrying out their purposes
>   (accountability);
> * "the belief that the best way to motivate people within these
>   organizations is by attaching rewards and penalties to their
>   measured performance, rewards that are either monetary
>   (pay-for-performance) or reputational (rankings)." (page 18)

"Recurring Flaws" from Chapter 2:

> * "Measuring the most easily measurable"
> * "measuring the simple when the desired outcome is complex"
> * "Measuring inputs rather than outcomes"
> * "Degrading information quality through standardization"
> * "Gaming through creaming"
> * "Improving numbers by lowering standards"
> * "Improving numbers through omission or distortion of data"
> * "Cheating"

> "Under scientific management the managers assume ... the burden of
> gathering together all of the traditional knowledge which in the
> past has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying,
> tabulating, and reducing this knowledge to rules, laws, formulae...
> Thus all of the planning which under the old system was done by the
> workmen, must of necessity under the new system be done by
> management in accordance with the law of science." ([Taylor][]
> quoted pages 32-33)


---

> "It is only through _enforced_ standardization of methods,
> _enforced_ adoption of the best implements and working conditions,
> and _enforced_ cooperation that this faster work can be assured. And
> the duty of enforcing the adoption of standards and enforcing this
> cooperation rests with _management_ alone." ([Taylor][] quoted page
> 33)

> "The calculative is the enemy of the imaginative." (page 61)

> "This lends a certain air of unreality to the explorations of what
> one might call the unworldly economists, who combine hard measures
> of statistical validity with weak interest in the validity of the
> units of measurement." (page 72)

The effect of valuing quantity over quality in academic publishing
leads to:

> "a great stream of publications that are both uninteresting and
> unread." (page 79)


---

> "This is an instance of _diagnostic_ metrics. It provides data that
> can be used by a practitioner (physician), or internally within an
> institution (hospital), or shared among practitioners and
> institutions to discover what is working and what is not, and to use
> that information to improve performance." (page 110)


---

> "... the metrics matter because of the way they are embedded into a
> larger institutional culture." (page 110)


---

> "Extrinsic rewards become an important determinant of job
> satisfaction only among workers for whom intrinsic rewards are
> relatively unavailable." ([Gruenberg][] quoted page 137)

> "The fact that allies spy on one another to a certain degree to
> determine intentions, capacities, and vulnerabilities is well known
> to practitioners of government. But it cannot be publicly
> acknowledged, since it represents a threat to the amour propre of
> other nations." (page 164)

Chapter 15 "Unintended but predictable negative consequences":

> * "Goal displacement through diversion of effort to what gets
>   measured"
> * "Promoting short-termism"
> * "Costs in employee time"
> * "Diminishing utility"
> * "Rule cascades" (to prevent gaming the metrics, etc.)
> * "Rewarding luck"
> * "Discouraging risk-taking"
> * "Discouraging innovation"
> * "Discouraging cooperation and common purpose"
> * "Degradation of work" (the experience of working people)
> * "Costs to productivity"

Chapter 16 "When and how to use metrics":

> 1. "What _kind_ of information are you thinking of measuring?"
> 2. "How _useful_ is the information?"
> 3. "How useful are _more_ metrics?"
> 4. "What are the costs of _not_ relying upon standardized
>    measurement?"
> 5. "To what _purposes_ will the measurement be put, or to put it
>    another way, to _whom_ will the information be made transparent?"
> 6. "What are the _costs_ of acquiring the metrics?"
> 7. "Ask why the people at the top of the organization are demanding
>    performance metrics."
> 8. "_How_ and _by whom_ are the measures of performance developed?"
> 9. "Remember that _even the best measures are subject to corruption
>    or goal diversion._"
> 10. "Remember that sometimes, recognizing the limits of the possible
>     is the beginning of wisdom."

Here Muller lists a factor outside the control of the American medical
system, citing page 84 of _In Excellent Health_ by Atlas and a paper
on [Socioeconomic Status and Health][]:

> "Moreover, the United States is an ethnically heterogeneous country,
> and some ethnic groups (such as African Americans) have
> disproportionately high rates of infant mortality, reflecting
> social, cultural, and possibly genetic factors." (p. 106)

This strikes me as, at the very least, unfortunate phrasing. Here's
[how some others talk][] about African American infant mortality rates:

> "It is racism, not race itself, that threatens the lives of African
> American women and infants."
