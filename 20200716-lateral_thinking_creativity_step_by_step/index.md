# Lateral Thinking: Creativity Step by Step

After a reference in [Peopleware][], I found Edward de Bono's [book][]
on [Lateral Thinking][]. I'd mostly heard about lateral thinking in
the context of brain-teasers, and was pleased to find much more depth.
This book could be a companion to [How to Solve It][].

Lateral Thinking is almost a textbook for a class in creativity,
complete with very concrete activities and teachers' guides. The topic
is orthogonal to deductive reasoning; it's about finding more starting
points rather than following one path.

This can be applied to problems with "correct" answers, but it also
applies to many other things: writing, design, planning, deciding what
other problems to work on. Nearly anything can benefit from "insight
restructuring."

One technique for finding new ideas is to use random input: take a
[random word][] or [random WikiPedia article][], juxtapose it with
your topic or problem, and see where you go. Using random input
reminds me of [noise in training neural networks][].

Throughout, de Bono emphasizes suspending judgment, which is useful
not just in brainstorming. One related practice is [yes, and][]: build
from ideas rather than shutting them down. A possible tactic is
"extracting the functional principle of the idea" (page 163): even if
the particulars seem unworkable, the underlying concept could be
affirmed and expanded.
