# Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital, by Perez

[Perez][] offers a [heterodox][] abduction from economic history, in
the tradition of [Schumpeter][] and [Kondratiev][], suggesting
[Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital][] dance through
"great surges" of 40 to 60 years, like giant [hype cycles][] driving
development.

(The hype cycle analogy isn't perfect; see [elsewhere][] for
summarization of Perez's formulation and five surges.)

Taking Dosi's extension of Kuhn's scientific paradigms to
[technological paradigms][] and further involving economics and
societal institutions (especially as capitalism vs. regulation), the
ideas are [not wholly original][], but neither are they very common.

Perez doesn't seem happy that the historical approach
[fell out of favor][] in economics, and it's neat to see her analysis
cover hundreds of years. This is economic history that doesn't just
refer to [Bretton Woods][], but also the [Peterloo Massacre][],
[Corn Laws][], and [nabobs][], to sample a few references. You know
about [May 1968 in Europe][], right?

This book is the closest thing I've seen to Asimov's
[psychohistory][], as in the [Foundation][] books. The time-scale
(around 50 years vs. thousands) and claimed predictive power (little
vs. godlike) are very different, but the ideas of anticipating
long-term shifts and being ready for them are analogous, and Perez
does discuss some psychosocial aspects, as in "ethical softening"
during parts of her surges.

The book was published in 2002. It was a theory that fit the dot-com
crash. How has the theory fit since then? The financial industry was
not much reined in, for one.

> crash)

Maybe the [Great Recession][] was just a late example of financial
adventurism. The theory suggests that shouldn't be happening so much
during the deployment phase of the age of information. It's easy to
feel like markets were _never_ really brought back in line with the
real economy. Have we been in a "gilded age"?

It should be about time for the start of a new surge. What will the
next big technology be?

> "It has often been suggested that biotechnology, bioelectrics and
> nanotechnology might conform the next technological revolution."
> (page 13)

From where I sit, AI/ML seems like a good candidate. Should we throw
in VR/AR? Blockchain? Private space? Does the social web constitute a
separate technology?

The book's theory treats technologies as available resources just
waiting for capital to fund them into prominence. I think this may be
too much of a simplification. In particular, it's [pretty hard][] to
guess in advance which technologies will take off and which will
fizzle, and I don't think there's any guarantee that there will always
be a technology at hand substantial enough to power another surge.

Alternatively, what if an even longer phase is coming to an end? What
if [declines in productivity growth][] are a real indication of the
[sigmoid][] peak of the [Market Society][] overall, and extended
financial weirdness a sign of an impending larger transformation of
societal system?

It certainly feels, in 2020, as if the world sits on a knife-edge,
with forces pulling in multiple directions. Hopefully history will
help us to create a worthy future.
