# Factfulness, by Rosling

[Factfulness][] finds [Rosling][] realizing that facts are not enough,
because thinking is polluted by "dramatic instincts," so his
presentation of little-known optimistic trends is organized to address
not just ignorance, but systematic biases in how people think.

1. _The Gap Instinct_: Giving its name to his [foundation][], this is
   the tendency to think groups are completely different. Usually even
   if group averages are different, the distributions significantly
   overlap.
2. _The Negativity Instinct_: Bad news is reported and feels salient,
   even if trends are positive overall.
3. _The Straight Line Instinct_: Trends are not always linear, but
   it's easiest to extrapolate as if they wereâ€”and be wrong.
4. _The Fear Instinct_: Fear is often not calibrated to true risk.
5. _The Size Instinct_: Understanding "big" requires appropriate
   comparison.
6. _The Generalization Instinct_: Both categories and anecdotes can be
   misleading.
7. _The Destiny Instinct_: Slow change is not the same as no change.
8. _The Single Perspective Instinct_: Understanding requires more than
   one approach, view, or tool (even statistics).
9. _The Blame Instinct_: Whether effects are good or bad, the reasons
   are probably more complex than just one individual or organization.
10. _The Urgency Instinct_: It's better to think and act carefully
    than jump into drastic moves.

Rosling wants us to realize our shared humanity, see that things have
mostly gotten better over long time scales, and work to keep improving
things. The philanthropy of [Bill Gates][] is largely working to
continue the trends Rosling focuses on, for example.

Like his classic [presentation][], celebrated by data visualizers, the
book is a study in good communication. I particularly noticed that he
often found opportunities to present dialogue rather than just
narrative, and that he used cute attention-getting flourishes like
using hypothetical "chimps" to stand in for random performance on his
quizzes.

I agree there's risk in assuming positive trends inevitably continue.
But it isn't fair to say Rosling ignored future risks. He listed five
things that he thought we _should_ worry about:

1. Global pandemic
2. Financial collapse
3. World War III
4. Climate change
5. Extreme poverty

Writing in 2017, he seems particularly prescient today.
