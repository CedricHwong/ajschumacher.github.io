# A Mathematician's Lament, by Lockhart

[Lockhart’s Lament][] (and [Exultation][]!) is [available][] as a
beautiful little book. It’s in the familiar territory of balancing
doing original things versus learning what others have done, but he’s
probably right that many people don’t really know what _doing_ math
is. I particularly identify with his emphasis on understanding and
good explanations.

Lockhart’s recommendation to do math for the pleasure of it reminds me
of McCullough’s similar thought on history:

> "It should be taught for pleasure: The pleasure of history, like art
> or music or literature, consists of an expansion of the experience
> of being alive, which is what education is largely about."
> ([McCullough][])

This is important to remember: People don’t really do things they
don’t enjoy. Pleasure can be found in most things, but it can be more
or less difficult to find. Finding it is important.

Lockhart correctly identifies the epistemology of math, in my opinion.
He points out that most people don’t need or use the math that’s
currently taught in schools, so losing it wouldn't be a great loss.
Carpenters don’t use trigonometry. Have you ever used the quadratic
formula?

I’m not sure Lockhart wrote to change anyone’s mind, and he doesn’t
include many approachable recommendations. On page 82 he says, "There
should be no standards, and no curriculum." He recommends [games][],
which is something, at least. He also teaches at a K-12 school where
students interview for a chance to pay $50k [tuition][]. I like his
ideas, but is there an accessible implementation?
