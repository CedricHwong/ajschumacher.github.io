# How Not to Be Wrong, by Ellenberg

I like [this book][] a lot. The five parts (Linearity, Inference,
Expectation, Regression, Existence) provide beautiful large-scale
structure, and it also shimmers on every page. Supreme court justices
encounter the word "orthogonal." There's a beautiful proof of
[Buffon's needle problem][]. There's some philosophy of math.
Ellenberg is a delight.

[Buffon's needle problem]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem

In some ways, How Not to Be Wrong is like a long version of
[Lockhart's exultation][], with examples. Lockhart extols the
[method of exhaustion][]; Ellenberg teaches it. The author clearly
loves math, and shares it generously with the reader.

[Lockhart's exultation]: /20200909-mathematicians_lament_by_lockhart/
[method of exhaustion]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion

The "How Not to Be Wrong" is delivered by exposing numerous common
fallacies or errors in understanding. Not every phenomenon is linear.
"Don't talk about percentages of numbers when the numbers might be
negative." "Improbable things happen a lot," and that affects how you
should think about significance tests and related things. The book is
a joy to read, I'd also read a "handbook" version collecting just the
main ideas.

I think he's referring to [multi-level modeling][], in the Gelman
style.

Ellenberg says "inference" but I might say "abduction."

This is connected to Bayesian stats as "inverse probability", and he
also notes that it's referred to as "[the prosecutor's fallacy][]" and
references the book _Math on Trial_.

Saying that even Fisher thinks our prior beliefs enter our work;
Fisher just has certain ideas about when it's appropriate to invoke
probability: he insists on some actual chance process.

[Finding Good Bets in the Lottery, and Why You Shouldn’t Take Them](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/Abrams2011.pdf) is a great reference, which I connect to my [Expected value is not useful for making decisions about lottery tickets](/2012/06/04/expected-value-is-not-useful-for-making/).


---

This gets at what I think is important: It isn't the expected value
you care about, it's your probability of being in a state that doesn't
suck. You want P(losing money) to become negligible, and that can
happen if you have positive expected value _and_ enough tickets.

The former is known unknowns (30% chance of drawing a black ball) and
the latter is unknown unknowns (maybe we're wrong about what the
chance is).

Ellenberg includes a fun table of Galton's on page 316, which has the

[Bertillonage][] (page 325) is kind of interesting and can be related
to modern systems that use data to track people, but it's also a lot
like a primitive "hashing" method for more quickly finding a record.

A section titled "It's not always wrong to be wrong" on page 354
suggests decision-making by expected value can be appropriate even if
it turns out later that a risk isn't as previously believed.

Ellenberg's immediate (and real, October 2010) example:

 * 52% oppose ACA
 * 41% support ACA

But:

 * 37% favor repeal of ACA
 * 10% favor weakening ACA
 * 15% favor maintaining ACA
 * 36% favor expanding ACA

This implies that some of the "oppose" people oppose it because they
want _more extreme_ policy than ACA, not less.

Describes formalism as being the tradition of definition; thinking
about what "1 - 1 + 1 -1 + ..." should be _defined as_, rather that
what it _is_. This can have the effect of replacing _meaning_ with
definition.

Say we have a contradiction, both A and not A, and want to show B.

Consider A and not B. A is false, so A and not B is false. Then since
A and not B is false, and A is true, not B is false, so B is true.
