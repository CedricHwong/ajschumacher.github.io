# AI Superpowers, by Lee

There's a lot [Kai-fu Lee][] isn't wrong about in [AI Superpowers][].
The major break-through of deep learning has occurred, and
applications are now more engineering than invention (cf. [Perez][]).
China has data, entrepreneurs, engineers, and government support for
AI. Compared to the US, China has fewer ethical qualms and democratic
controls, which Lee propagandizes as advantages for China. I think
he's right that we should worry more about human society than about
[AGI][], but I think he exaggerates the exceptionalism of AI.

The boundary between AI and non-AI computing isn't clear. There have
been industrial robots for years. Does it matter whether Google search
is powered by [PageRank][] or [BERT][]? It's hard to pin down exactly
what's AI and what isn't. But this isn't my main objection.

There has _already been_ a trend toward concentration of corporate
power, economic inequality, and unemployment/underemployment. The main
problem with Harari's "[useless class][]" idea is his use of the
future tense. The useless class is here already.

It might be better to discuss issues of the future of society in
connections with AI rather than not at all, but I worry that the focus
on AI can distract from bigger trends approaches that aren't tied to
AI. It isn't useful to make new AI a scapegoat for existing phenomena.

I think Lee overestimates the magnitude of AI's direct impact on jobs,
but maybe not the magnitude of the overall trend in jobs. Regardless,
he then spends the back of the book opining on public policy after his
come-to-Jesus (not literally) experience with cancer. He praises
volunteers and then proposes that we must pay people for things they
would volunteer to do if they didn't have to worry about money. I
don't oppose paying teachers (etc.) more, but I think he's
fundamentally wrong about how humans work, and I think he's way
outside his area of expertise.

> "In my view, that [Chinese/US] lead in AI development will translate

---

> "Based on the current trends in technology advancement and adoption,
> I predict that within fifteen years, artificial intelligence will
> technically be able to replace around 40 to 50 percent of jobs in
> the United States. Actual job losses may end up lagging those
> technical capabilities by an additional decade, but I forecast that

Published in 2018, so that's capability by 2033 and job losses by
2043.

Even if this well-known judge study were replicated and broadly
believed (which it is [not][]), Lee's reference is still rather
appalling excuse-making for racist algorithms.

Describes [Smart Finance][] as a technological leap-frog AI success
story (page 112-113) but many would describe it as a privacy and
fairness nightmare.
