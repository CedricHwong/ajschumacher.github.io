# Anki is easy

[Anki][], named after the Japanese for "memorization," is a
[spaced repetition][] flashcard app. I've been interested in it
before, but I didn't jump in because it seemed like a commitment to
install it and be an Anki person. It turns out you don't need to
install anything, you can use [AnkiWeb][] for free online, so I've
started adding cards and it's fun!

Now I keep an [AnkiWeb][] tab open and add things I want to remember
as I come across them. A failure mode I experienced playing with
similar software in the past was adding pre-made decks of cards from
other people, which leads to frustration and just not caring about
them. Much better to add just occasional things that you care about.

Now instead of just complaining about my memory, I'm also doing
something about it!
