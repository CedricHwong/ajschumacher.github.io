# Bad Choices, by Almossawi

I enjoyed Almossawi's illustrated introduction to computational
thinking, which is [freely available][] online. I've been [thinking][]
about non-fiction(ish) books for kids, and this one could be read by
middle-schoolers, I think, and possibly spark interest in learning
more. It illustrates the challenges and rewards of telling stories
about computer science topics.

Almossawi has one of his distinctive [mind map][]s toward the end of
the book. Linearized, the topics in the book look something like this:

[mind map]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map

 * Fundamentals
     * Stacks
     * Arrays
     * Linked lists
     * Asymptotic notation
     * Worst, average cases
 * Searching
     * Binary search
     * Linear search
     * Hash tables
 * Sorting
     * Library sort
     * Priority queues
     * Mergesort
     * Quicksort
     * Insertion sort
 * Graphs
     * Maze-solving
     * Link analysis
 * Strings
     * Huffman coding

> "Note that all the lines in this book are plotted on a log-log

> (page xi)

I would have liked to see this better explained. The lines are never
labeled, and I'm not sure why this was intentional.

> "The lines in those graphs were intentionally unlabeled." (page 137)

Unless it was for this reason:

> "In my experience, any learning environment that encourages students
> to be fast learners is setting its students up for failure." (page
> xi)

That's interesting, but I'm not sure it's a good justification. At
least, I think it would be good to be explicit, like: "Add your own
labels to these," if that's what the reader is supposed to do.

The "to learn more" section says this is from "Most Likely to Succeed:
Preparing Our Kids for the Innovation Era."

A glitch in the [Huffman coding][] example (starting page 69) is
corrected in the [errata][].

The "to learn more" section references [For Worldâ€™s Newest Scrabble Stars, SHORT Tops SHORTER](https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-nigerian-scrabble-stars-short-tops-shorter-1463669734).

This seems sort of interesting, but I don't see a good reference for
it.

I would love to find this writing!
