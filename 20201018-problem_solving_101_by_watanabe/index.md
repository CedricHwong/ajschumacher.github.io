# Problem Solving 101, by Watanabe

This [book][] by a former [McKinsey][] consultant "started as a simple
guide to teach Japanese schoolchildren critical thinking skills." It's
a different perspective than the more math-focused
[How to Solve It][], for example, focusing on problems of everyday
life.

### Watanabe's steps:

1. "understand the current situation"
2. "identify the root cause of the problem"
3. "develop an effective action plan"
4. "execute until the problem is solved, making modifications as necessary"


### PÃ³lya's steps:

1. First, you have to understand the problem.
2. After understanding, make a plan.
3. Carry out the plan.
4. Look back on your work. How could it be better?


From these we learn that five steps is too many steps.

Watanabe emphasizes a number of visual aids:

 * "Logic tree" - break something down into sub-groups, exhaustively
 * "Yes/no tree" - a logic tree with yes/no logic, drawn as a
   flowchart
 * "Problem-solving design plan" - columns for Issue, Hypothesis,
   Rationale, Analysis/Activities, Information Source (mostly about
   understanding the problem)
 * "Hypothesis pyramid" - Boxes with arrows to show (possible)
   contributing factors for a conclusion, both for plausible reasoning
   and for deductive reasoning as appropriate
 * "Pros and cons; Criteria and evaluation" - Tables with various
   structure for pros and cons

A couple times he also uses quadrant charts where the axes are impact
and effort (for prioritizing). An interesting variation is that he has
his characters think about how to _change_ the required effort by
asking friends for help, etc.

That quote is [disputed][].
