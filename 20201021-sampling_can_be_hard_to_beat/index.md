# Sampling can be hard to beat, for text understanding

If you have a lot of related documents (like thousands of reviews of a
product, or answers to a survey question) you might be tempted to use
an automatic procedure to summarize them (maybe making a word cloud,
or applying [LDA][], or something fancier). No automated process is
flawless, but if you need to work with many groups of documents, such
an approach could be called for. Regardless of whether you use an
automated technique, you should still start by reading a sample of
documents, and in fact reading may be the best way to understand what
people have said.

This is a special case of a few more general principles:

 * Look at the data
 * Simple techniques can be very effective
 * Start with a baseline for comparison
