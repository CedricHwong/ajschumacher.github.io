# Failure to Disrupt, by Reich

As is especially salient during a pandemic, "technology alone can't
transform education." Reich's [book][] nicely wraps up the most recent
edtech hype cycle, which I was more optimistic about [at the time][]. Reich thinks we have to keep [tinkering toward utopia][].

 * Kinds of edtech "learning at scale"
     * <a href="#chapter1">MOOCs</a> (instructor-guided)
     * <a href="#chapter2">adaptive tutors</a> (algorithm-guided)
     * <a href="#chapter3">open world</a> (self/peer-guided)
     * <a href="#chapter4">games</a> (aspects mostly of adaptive and open)
 * Challenges
     * <a href="#chapter5">difficult to get adoption</a>

     * <a href="#chapter7">complex tasks defy simple assessments</a>
     * <a href="#chapter8">data/experiments risks/benefits</a>
 * <a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a>

I mostly agree with Reich, except that now I tend to put more weight
on knowledge à la [Hirsch][], and I still have hope for the
application of tools like [Anki][] in educational settings.

### <a name="chapter1"></a>Chapter 1: Instructor-Guided Learning at Scale: Massive Open Online Courses

> "To a first approximation, there are only two primary approaches to
> teaching and learning. As Plutarch wrote in "On Listening" in the
> first century CE, "Education is not the filling of a pail, but the
> lighting of a fire."" (page 22)

Reich then identifies "instructionism" and "social constructivism" as
names for these approaches, associated with Edward L. Thorndike and
John Dewey, respectively.

One thing I thought I noticed in edtech over the years was a trend in
which companies that focused on algorithms (like [Knewton][]) moved
toward being more like content companies over time. In a sense they
started as pail companies, but found people wouldn't buy empty pails.
Might be related to the <a href="#chapter5">adoption problem</a>.

[Knewton]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knewton

This is a fun metaphor to play with. I think it might be better as
"not the stacking of wood, but the lighting of a fire." When a fire is
burning, you want to keep getting more wood. The wood is largely the
same in both approaches; the difference is the motivation or
application around it.

This doesn't seem true. Maybe it means that with a log y axis, the
left and right sides are each approximately linear? I [tweeted][] at
Reich about this.

Makes me think about whole-group single track, tracking, personalized
via computer, tutoring, and how these are thought about in different
ways...

Roughly, this is referring to personalizing _pace_ (go through the
same material but at whatever speed you like) versus personalizing
_content_ (choose your own area of interest, pursue it however you
want).

Reich raises the issue of people choosing to get involved in bad stuff
like hate groups. So total freedom in what to get into isn't
necessarily great.

Is he deliberately avoiding the obvious interpretation from
selection/observation bias? In a whole world, some people have
motivation and comprehension to do great things. If you have a fixed
group of students that isn't skimming those people, many won't. It
seems highly likely that peer-guided learning at scale has the same
issue as other MOOCs, in that the people who benefit are
overwhelmingly people who are already doing really well to begin with.


---

Thinking about the various ways to do whole class together vs. totally
personalized/independent learning... When I was teaching,
"differentiation" was the popular term for customizing class
activities for students who were struggling or way ahead...

I think really, there's some stuff that we want all students to learn,
and there are learning experiences that make sense to do with a whole
class: stuff about working in groups, communication, etc. It would be
neat to have more explicit separation between a small whole-group set
of content, and scaffolding for students to study more things on their
own.

### <a name="chapter4"></a>Chapter 4: Testing the Genres of Learning at Scale: Learning Games


---

The difficulty of _transfer_ (mentioned page 109) makes me wonder to
what extent transfer is related to general intelligence - or whether
they might even be largely the same thing.

The referenced _Critical Thinking: Why Is It So Hard to Teach?_
([web][], [more complete PDF][]) is quite good.

But: some reasonable notes on, for example, the general strategy of
knowing to look things up online.

This [Zoombinis][] game seems kind of neat? Maybe mathier puzzles than
other puzzle games? Or not? Shrug?

> "The dilemma that Resnick and colleagues face as Scratch is widely

I think Reich is neglecting something that Scratch has in common with
most edtech, and which he comments on for other types: Learning with
Scratch depends hugely on the student being prepared for and/or having
characteristics that align with learning with Scratch.

---

### <a name="chapter7"></a>Chapter 7: The Trap of Routine Assessment


---

> "Autograders excel at assessing routine tasks. These are exactly the
> kinds of tasks that we no longer need humans to do." (page 171)

This is incomplete. There are lots of basic things that humans need to
be able to do that can be assessed automatically. But I agree that
higher-level skills are difficult to assess automatically.


---

Reich makes an example of a plumber who installs a water heater with
an LED panel and then says on page 175: "What would it be like to
explain to the young men in that apprenticeship program that fifty
years later, plumbers would be computer programmers?" This isn't the
case. The plumber who in fact installed his water heater didn't do any
programming. This was a bad example for the point I think Reich hoped
to make.


---

> "... the "reification fallacy," when we uncritically believe that
> something's name accurately represents what that thing actually is."

Somewhat unusual way of explaining [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)). Interesting.


---

> "Computers can mostly assess what computers are good at doing, and
> these are things we do not need humans to do in the labor market."
> (page 197)

I already commented on this, but I'll comment again: I think he's
ignoring the many things that humans should be able to do that
computers can also do. I'm thinking mostly of simple recall, where
knowing something by heart (immediately) is way better than being able
to look it up (if you even know that it exists, to look up).


---

### <a name="chapter8"></a>Chapter 8: The Toxic Power of Data and Experiments


---

Mostly, I think Reich is pulling punches in this chapter. He doesn't
go where I thought he was going to: He doesn't really address possible
abuses of student data or the negative effects that can arise
(intentionally or accidentally) from data and experiment.


---

> "If online learning leads to better outcomes from students, it will
> be through the amalgamation of a thousand or ten thousand studies
> like this one that incrementally accrete a knowledge base about
> effective online learning." (page 223)

I think Reich takes his "tinkering" a little too far sometimes. If
what's really needed is a bigger leap, ten thousand incremental
experiments won't necessarily get there.
