# How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, by Bennett

I've recommended this 1908 [book][] since [2010][]/[2011][], and I
thought I'd revisit it. The sexist language makes it hard to continue
recommending; I'd love to see a modern version.

The main message I take from this reading is the need to slow down,
when trying to do more. Reflect. Think. It's not packing as much as
possible into the time you have, it's getting as much as you can out.
As with eating, the good life isn't just quantity per time.

I relate aspects of this book to more recent [ideas][] about
[learning][] and memory, which I also think are good. Many of the
charming aspects of the book relate to the _why_ more than the _how_
of learning, and try to encourage the reader to believe that they
_can_ find the time to do more. (A modern version might reference
statistics on [screen-watching][], and find that people have a lot of
time that might be better spent.)

Taken mildly, Bennett's advice is to get a hobby, to develop an
interest, aligned with "cultivation of the mind." Taken more
seriously, he encourages more purposeful, joyful, and "examined" life.
I can get behind both sentiments.
