# Game Changer, by Solomon and Blumberg

I picked this up because of the subtitle, "How to be 10x in the talent
economy." I'm interested in human [differences in productivity][]. The
[book][] had little to say on the technical side, but emphasized
balancing "hard" and "soft" skills, with a big focus on continual
improvement via feedback and coaching. The book is largely an
advertisement for the authors' businesses (10x [management][] /
[ascend][]) and I think fairly effective as such.

I've worked in a couple companies with variations on the theme of
having a "career manager" and a "project manager," sometimes the same
person, which can engender conflicts of interest. Solomon and
Blumberg's talent management model essentially outsources your career
management to an independent firm, which is interesting. It could be
viewed as a kind of [matrixing][] that extends beyond company borders.

Another way of viewing it is as starting your own consultancy but
outsourcing lead generation (and some other functions, like contracts)
to Solomon and Blumberg. That removes a major difficulty of going it
alone, if it works well. There are still trade-offs associated with
working 1099 vs. W-2 jobs; better health insurance options etc. would
still help more people make the leap toward greater independence from
corporations.

The authors give a quantitative example early on to make "10x" real:

> "Two weeks later, Nicole returned to our office with the news that
> she had let go of no less than thirty-three of her thirty-six-person
> team. _More than 90 percent._ She was sorry to lay off that many
> fine workers and was quick to mention that they were well taken care
> of, but there was no way around this one simple fact: Our three
> recommended 10xers could deliver a better, stronger, more
> sustainable product than thirty-three or even a hundred engineers
> who were just "very good."" (page xiv)

There's some interesting conversation to be had about labor relations,
the future of work, and what direction we really want to move in, I
think.

On page 16 they reference
[The two-pizza rule and the secret of Amazon's success](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/24/the-two-pizza-rule-and-the-secret-of-amazons-success).

They speak positively about Objectives and Key Results ([OKRs][])...
Maybe I should try those?

They have a neat [Lifestyle Calculator][] for considering 24 different
priorities in considering a job.

Chapter 3, "Success and Sabotage–The Manageability Continuum," is
largely about growth via feedback, and hiring for people who can do
that.

> "The cost of a bad hire is incalculable, and not just from a
> financial perspective." (page 57)

> ten, how weird are you?'_ And I never hire lower than a seven.""
> (page 59, quoting Scott Goldsmith)

On pages 62-63, they highlight three interview questions:

1. How well did the potential 10xer handle a significant mistake of
   their own making?
2. How does the potential 10xer handle a situation where a boss or
   client wants something he or she thinks is a bad idea?
3. What does the potential 10xer identify as their biggest
   professional weaknesses?

On page 70 they talk about the [Johari window][].

The book doesn't say much of anything about genetic contributions to
being "10x" and this quote isn't intended to be related to that topic,
but the concept is sort of uncomfortably in the background somehow...

(Part of some recommended language for soliciting feedback.)

On page 200, they talk about what they call a "L.E.A.P. doc" which is
an employment List of Expectations and Priorities, which they suggest
sending as a kind of first move in negotiating employment. An
interesting idea.
