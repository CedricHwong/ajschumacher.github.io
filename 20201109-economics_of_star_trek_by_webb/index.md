# The Economics of Star Trek, by Webb

I read the print version of the [blog post][], which delivers on the
fun of thinking about a world with the economics of the Star Trek
future. In the end you can't expect scifi to deliver economic
salvation, but imaginative inspiration is a fine starting point for
learning and thinking more.

I didn't really find Webb's guesses to constitute a workable system,
though I can't really say whether the problem is his, Star Trek's, or
the failure of my imagination.

There's also an even more serious book on this topic: [Trekonomics][],
by Manu Saadia.

This is a strange mix of dark and light...

(In Star Trek, many advances happened following
[The Eugenics Wars of the 1990s][].)

Webb also opines on page 141 that "the sense lingers that if we _are_
to arrive at a Trek vision of the future, we might have to go through
our own version of The Eugenics Wars to get there."

Interesting bit on page 90 about a UBI study showing it increased
divorce rates (which people took as a bad thing, I think) but then
later it turned out the divorce result was a statistical error.

John Kenneth Galbraith's [The Affluent Society][] is referenced on
pages 134-135 as a text whose "arguments can be said to underpin [the]
Trek ideal."

[Social Limits to Growth]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hirsch#Limits_to_Growth

Page 135 also references Fred Hirsch's [Social Limits to Growth][].

[The Affluent Society]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Affluent_Society

Page 141 references
[Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work][] and
the [Mont Pelerin Society][] (though as "the Mount Perlan Society").
