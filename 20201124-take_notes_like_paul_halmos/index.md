# Take notes like Paul Halmos

[Paul Halmos][] recommended taking minimalist notes and then later
expanding the notes from memory. This lets you pay more attention in
the moment and then exercise your recall afterward, which is good for
memory. Paired with speech-to-text transcription, you can also avoid
the risk of missing anything.

Here's how Halmos explained note-taking in his automathography:

> "Lecture courses are a standard way of learning something–one of the
> worst ways. Too passive, that's the trouble. Standard
> recommendation: take notes. Counter argument: yes, to be sure,
> taking notes is an activity, and if you do it, you have something
> solid to refer back to afterward, but you are likely to miss the
> delicate details of the presentation as well as the big picture, the
> Gestalt–you are too busy scribbling to pay attention. Counter
> counter-argument: if you don't take notes, you won't remember what
> happened, in what order it came, and, chances are, your attention
> will flag part of the time, you'll daydream, and, who knows, you
> might even nod off.
>
> "It's all true, the arguments both for and against taking notes. My
> own solution is a compromise: I take very skimpy notes, and then,
> whenever possible, I transcribe them, in much greater detail, as
> soon afterward as possible. By very skimpy notes I mean something
> like one or two words a minute, plus, possibly a crucial formula or
> two and a crucial picture or two–just enough to fix the order of
> events, and, incidentally, to keep me awake and on my toes. By
> transcribe I mean in enough detail to show a friend who wasn't
> there, with some hope that he'll understand what he missed." (Paul
> Halmos, "I want to be a mathematician")
