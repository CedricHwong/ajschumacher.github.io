# Relaxing News

Often, when I check the news, I don't really want news. I just want to
stop looking at whatever I was looking at. Just for a second. But the
news is distracting. So I made a [redirect][] that goes to a random
nice picture. It's available at [bit.ly/relaxing-news][]. Enjoy!

The pictures are from [National Geographic][]. The redirect goes to
their servers.
