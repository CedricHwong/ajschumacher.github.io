Anticipating likely difficulties of life in Korea, I struck upon the
idea of telling Koreans that I'm German. I wanted to learn Korean,
after all, and it wouldn't do me a bit of good to go about speaking
English all the time.

In practice, this is something like planning to move to the ocean
floor and tell compressed air canisters that you're from Venus, and
would you please take your oxygen somewhere else thanks. On the one
hand, oxygen is frankly useful down there. And on the other, if you
actually happen on a canister of superheated methane it's bound to be
embarrassing.

yesterday I threw out my spent deoderant, toothpaste, and toothbrush

I bought some here
