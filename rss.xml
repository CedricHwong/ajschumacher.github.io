<title>Sampling can be hard to beat, for text understanding</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>If you have a lot of related documents (like thousands of reviews of a
product, or answers to a survey question) you might be tempted to use
an automatic procedure to summarize them (maybe making a word cloud,
or applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation">LDA</a>, or something fancier). No automated process is
flawless, but if you need to work with many groups of documents, such
an approach could be called for. Regardless of whether you use an
automated technique, you should still start by reading a sample of
documents, and in fact reading may be the best way to understand what
people have said.</p>
<p>This is a special case of a few more general principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the data</li>
<li>Simple techniques can be very effective</li>
<li>Start with a baseline for comparison</li>
</ul>

<title>The Point of Pointless Work, by Almossawi</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The title's not quite right, but there's some on that. <a href="https://almossawi.com/pointless-work/">It</a>'s mostly
Almossawi's personal adventures in publishing: the stories of
<a href="/20201012-bad_arguments_by_almossawi/">Bad Arguments</a> and <a href="/20201011-bad_choices_by_almossawi/">Bad Choices</a>. I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I liked the detail about publishing, including buying a pack of ten
ISBNs, and agonizing about getting pallets of books from a ship and
into Amazon fulfillment centers.</p>
<p>I also think he's right that it's good for people to do things not
just out of economic necessity, and we're fortunate when we're able to
do so.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Selected quotes and commentary</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Anatol Rapoport has excellent advice about how to criticize. A
critic, he says, ought to begin by stating the other side's position
in a fair and objective way, then mentioning the areas of agreement,
and only then mentioning the areas of disagreement. The approach
does wonders when the goal is to turn something into a better
version of itself rather than to posture." (page 42)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also found more on this in a <a href="http://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/06/16/rapoport-rules-criticism/">post</a> based on a book by Dennett
which is in my to-read pile.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was surprised to find that the copyeditors were all freelancers.
... When [prior employee copyeditors] retired, the publisher
determined that it made economic and organizational sense to
outsource that responsibility to freelancers." (page 74)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet another example of trying to get work done by contractors rather
than employees.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... Abraham Flexner's essay from almost a century ago on useless
knowledge." (page 100)</p>
</blockquote>

<title>Problem Solving 101, by Watanabe</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/304164/problem-solving-101-by-ken-watanabe/">book</a> by a former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_%26_Company">McKinsey</a> consultant "started as a simple
guide to teach Japanese schoolchildren critical thinking skills." It's
a different perspective than the more math-focused
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It">How to Solve It</a>, for example, focusing on problems of everyday
life.</p>
<h3>Watanabe's steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>"understand the current situation"</li>
<li>"identify the root cause of the problem"</li>
<li>"develop an effective action plan"</li>
<li>"execute until the problem is solved, making modifications as necessary"</li>
</ol>
<h3>P&#243;lya's steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, you have to understand the problem.</li>
<li>After understanding, make a plan.</li>
<li>Carry out the plan.</li>
<li>Look back on your work. How could it be better?</li>
</ol>
<p>From these we learn that five steps is too many steps.</p>
<p>Watanabe emphasizes a number of visual aids:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Logic tree" - break something down into sub-groups, exhaustively</li>
<li>"Yes/no tree" - a logic tree with yes/no logic, drawn as a
   flowchart</li>
<li>"Problem-solving design plan" - columns for Issue, Hypothesis,
   Rationale, Analysis/Activities, Information Source (mostly about
   understanding the problem)</li>
<li>"Hypothesis pyramid" - Boxes with arrows to show (possible)
   contributing factors for a conclusion, both for plausible reasoning
   and for deductive reasoning as appropriate</li>
<li>"Pros and cons; Criteria and evaluation" - Tables with various
   structure for pros and cons</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple times he also uses quadrant charts where the axes are impact
and effort (for prioritizing). An interesting variation is that he has
his characters think about how to <em>change</em> the required effort by
asking friends for help, etc.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Selected quotes and (very rarely) comments</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Being a problem solver isn't just an ability; it's a whole
mind-set, one that drives people to bring out the best in themselves
and to shape the world in a positive way." (page ix)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... approaches to broaden and organize one's thinking ..." (page x)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Problem solving isn't a talent limited to the lucky few. It's
actually a skill and a habit that you can learn." (page 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"People often fall into the trap of collecting information and
conducting analyses just for the sake of doing them." (page 38)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you start collecting and analyzing data without first clarifying
the question you are trying to answer, you're probably doing
yourself more harm than good." (page 39)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"As Seneca said, "Luck is what happens when preparation meets
opportunity."" (page 109)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That quote is <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger#Disputed">disputed</a>.</p>

<title>Bad Arguments, by Almossawi</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I wondered if there was a book of fallacies, and it turned out there
were several. Almossawi's is the cutest by far, and it's
<a href="https://bookofbadarguments.com/">freely available</a> online.</p>
<p>Thinking about fallacies is a fun way to think about how we reason,
and how we conceptualize things. There's no one correct taxonomy of
fallacies, and fallacies aren't always bad arguments. Books like this
are good for starting to access some of these ideas.</p>
<hr>
<p>Almossawi has one of his distinctive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind map</a>s at the beginning of
the book. Linearized, the topics in the book look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical fallacies<ul>
<li>Formal<ul>
<li>Propositional<ul>
<li><strong>Affirming the consequent</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Informal<ul>
<li>Ambiguity<ul>
<li><strong>Equivocation</strong><ul>
<li>Redefinition<ul>
<li><strong>No true Scotsman</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Causal<ul>
<li><strong>Not a cause for a cause</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Slippery slope</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unwarranted assumption<ul>
<li><strong>False dilemma</strong></li>
<li><strong>Composition and division</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Begging the question<ul>
<li><strong>Circular reasoning</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weak analogy<ul>
<li>Unrepresentative sample<ul>
<li><strong>Hasty generalization</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Missing data<ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to ignorance</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Red herrings<ul>
<li><strong>Argument from consequences</strong></li>
<li><strong>Guilt by association</strong></li>
<li><strong>Straw man</strong></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to the bandwagon</strong></li>
<li>Emotional appeal<ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to fear</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Genetic fallacy</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to irrelevant authority</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ad hominem</strong></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to hypocrisy</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it's a good idea to organize ideas like this. It shows
clearly, for example, how many "different" fallacies are fundamentally
red herrings, according to the author. It also helps draw out that the
names of the fallacies aren't so important; in each case you could
just as well simply explain an argument's problem without using the
name.</p>
<p>It's fun to think about organizing these. Here's a different way I was
thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems with premises<ul>
<li><strong>Circular reasoning</strong> (A implies A is fine; the problem is
   starting with A.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arguing the wrong thing<ul>
<li>Ambiguity<ul>
<li><strong>Equivocation</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Redefinition<ul>
<li><strong>No true Scotsman</strong></li>
<li><strong>Straw man</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>False dilemma</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problems with form of argument (Non Sequitur)<ul>
<li><strong>Affirming the consequent</strong></li>
<li>Weak analogy<ul>
<li>Unrepresentative sample<ul>
<li><strong>Hasty generalization</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Missing data<ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to ignorance</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Causal<ul>
<li><strong>Not a cause for a cause</strong></li>
<li><strong>Slippery slope</strong> (This is sort of an odd one out; it's
   only a fallacy if it introduces some fallacious component,
   which could just as well be identified separately.
   [<a href="http://www.csun.edu/~dgw61315/fallacies.html#Slippery%20slope">discussion</a>])</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unwarranted assumption<ul>
<li><strong>Composition and division</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distractions from topic<ul>
<li><strong>Argument from consequences</strong></li>
<li><strong>Guilt by association</strong></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to the bandwagon</strong></li>
<li>Emotional appeal<ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to fear</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Genetic fallacy</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to irrelevant authority</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ad hominem</strong></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to hypocrisy</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think red herrings are generally non sequiturs, but they may not
necessarily be fallacies, in a probabilistic sense. Heck, even the
most "logical" fallacy (affirming the consequent) can still count as
evidence for a proposition.</p>
<p>Almossawi does also note on page 40 (ad hominem) "That said, there are
situations where one may legitimately question a person's credibility,
such as during trial testimony."</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are
the easiest person to fool. - Richard P. Feynman"</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 4, a reference to Gula's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nonsense-Herrings-Sacred-Everyday-Language/dp/1604191252/">Nonsense</a>, which might be a sort
of non-illustrated/longer version of Bad Arguments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That book reminded me of a list of guidelines that I had scribbled
down in a notebook a decade ago about how to argue; they were the
result of several years of arguing with strangers in online forums
and they included, for example, "Try not to make general claims
about things." That is obvious to me now, but to a schoolboy, it was
an exciting revelation." (page 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"One may reasonably appeal to <em>pertinent</em> authority, as scientists
and academics typically do. A vast majority of the things that we
believe in, such as atoms and the solar system, are on reliable
authority, as are all historical statements, to paraphrase C. S.
Lewis."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> "was a British writer and lay theologian" - is
Almossawi paraphrasing him on the appeal to authority as a joke? Not
that the claim is wrong, just that it's a funny place to cite an
unrelated figure.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Inductive argument: An <em>argument</em> in which if the <em>premisses</em> are
true, then it is probable that the conclusion will also be true."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what P&#243;lya calls plausible reasoning, maybe to avoid the
confusion with mathematical induction or the specific/general
explanation (which I reject) for deductive/inductive reasoning.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://www.livescience.com/21569-deduction-vs-induction.html">this</a> claim: "Inductive reasoning is the opposite of
deductive reasoning." is not particularly helpful. (This site is heavy
on the "deduction is general to specific, induction is specific to
general".)</p>
<p>This <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/#DedIndAbd">other</a> site has this example of induction: &#8220;John lives in
Chelsea&#8221; and &#8220;Most people living in Chelsea are rich&#8221; gives to &#8220;John
is rich.&#8221; This does not go from specific to general.</p>
<p>Plausible reasoning precedes logical reasoning (Almossawi quotes
Minsky: "Logic no more explains how we think than grammar explains how
we speak") and yet logical fallacies somewhat rudely direct us to
mistrust heuristics that are useful for plausible reasoning. This
relates to the idea of language being a model: the famous syllogism
takes "All men are mortal" as true, but really it's just highly
plausible. You really have to assume the premises.</p>
<p>In fact we could just as well speak of the Inductive Fallacy, and use
it to argue against all manner of things that are understood to be
true.</p>

<title>Bad Choices, by Almossawi</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I enjoyed Almossawi's illustrated introduction to computational
thinking, which is <a href="https://bookofbadchoices.com/">freely available</a> online. I've been <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/issues/198">thinking</a>
about non-fiction(ish) books for kids, and this one could be read by
middle-schoolers, I think, and possibly spark interest in learning
more. It illustrates the challenges and rewards of telling stories
about computer science topics.</p>
<hr>
<p>Almossawi has one of his distinctive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind map</a>s toward the end of
the book. Linearized, the topics in the book look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals<ul>
<li>Stacks</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Linked lists</li>
<li>Asymptotic notation</li>
<li>Worst, average cases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Searching<ul>
<li>Binary search</li>
<li>Linear search</li>
<li>Hash tables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sorting<ul>
<li>Library sort</li>
<li>Priority queues</li>
<li>Mergesort</li>
<li>Quicksort</li>
<li>Insertion sort</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Graphs<ul>
<li>Maze-solving</li>
<li>Link analysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strings<ul>
<li>Huffman coding</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Note that all the lines in this book are plotted on a log-log
scale, which is why the shapes of the lines are the way they are."
(page xi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would have liked to see this better explained. The lines are never
labeled, and I'm not sure why this was intentional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The lines in those graphs were intentionally unlabeled." (page 137)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless it was for this reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In my experience, any learning environment that encourages students
to be fast learners is setting its students up for failure." (page
xi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's interesting, but I'm not sure it's a good justification. At
least, I think it would be good to be explicit, like: "Add your own
labels to these," if that's what the reader is supposed to do.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you look at human history, you're likely to find that many of
the names you recognize belong to people who were educated as
apprentices rather than as note takers." (page 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "to learn more" section says this is from "Most Likely to Succeed:
Preparing Our Kids for the Innovation Era."</p>
<hr>
<p>A glitch in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coding</a> example (starting page 69) is
corrected in the <a href="https://github.com/almossawi/badchoices/wiki/Errata">errata</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Interestingly, though, Morse determined the frequency of various
letters not by talking to experts or conducting a study or analyzing
data, but by counting the number of types in a printer's type box.
So the next time a pedant questions your research methods, take
heart." (page 72)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> published an article recently about the
rise of scrabble champions in Nigeria, and how their winning edge
isn't necessarily due to a better vocabulary but rather to the
counterintuitive tactic of opting for shorter words." (page 80)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "to learn more" section references <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-nigerian-scrabble-stars-short-tops-shorter-1463669734">For World&#8217;s Newest Scrabble Stars, SHORT Tops SHORTER</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We tend to interpret new information in a way that fits with what
we already believe. It's what computer scientist Alan Kay calls
relativizing." (page 84)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems sort of interesting, but I don't see a good reference for
it.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Douglas Carl Engelbart, inventor of the computer mouse, has written
about the need to not only make the process of completing a set of
tasks more efficient, but also the process of questioning whether
the tasks are essential to begin with." (page 84)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would love to find this writing!</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We can't really explain a heap by analogy." (page 120)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"When Feynman was once asked how he developed his legendary ability

<title>Anki is easy</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)">Anki</a>, named after the Japanese for "memorization," is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> flashcard app. I've been interested in it
before, but I didn't jump in because it seemed like a commitment to
install it and be an Anki person. It turns out you don't need to
install anything, you can use <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">AnkiWeb</a> for free online, so I've
started adding cards and it's fun!</p>
<p>Now I keep an <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">AnkiWeb</a> tab open and add things I want to remember
as I come across them. A failure mode I experienced playing with
similar software in the past was adding pre-made decks of cards from
other people, which leads to frustration and just not caring about
them. Much better to add just occasional things that you care about.</p>
<p>Now instead of just complaining about my memory, I'm also doing
something about it!</p>

<title>Fusion isn't so hard</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I saw somebody <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/amp/news/2020/10/middle-school-student-achieved-nuclear-fusion-in-his-family-playroom-631163">post</a> about a kid achieving nuclear fusion at home,
and I was sure it was fake news. It referenced <a href="https://fusor.net/">fusor.net</a>, which
also looks fake. But the concept, at least, is real!
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor">WikiPedia</a>/<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/nuclear/fusion-on-a-budget">IEEE</a>) How cool! For a couple thousand dollars or
so, you can make a fusion reactor in your house, on a desk! I feel
like this should be more widely known.</p>
<p>You mostly hear about fusion in stars, which makes it seem... big. And
far away. Knowing you can do it as a hobbyist if you feel like makes
it seem so much more approachable! Together with the naturally
occurring fission <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/natures-nuclear-reactors-the-2-billion-year-old-natural-fission-reactors-in-gabon-western-africa/">reactors</a>, there are cool non-bomb, non-star
examples of both fission and fusion. Nice!</p>
<p>Also did you know you can buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium">deuterium</a>? I think you can probably
get it as a gas, but you can also just buy yourself some heavy water
if you want! It's just water, but with extra neutrons on the hydrogen!
How cool!</p>
<p>The good and bad of home fusion is that it's just a <em>little</em> bit of
fusion, and it takes a lot more energy to make it happen than you get
out. So it doesn't blow up, and the extra radioactivity won't kill you
very fast. As far as I can tell, these fusor devices are in a weird
zone of not being regulated, I think, because they're hard enough to
make and not quite dangerous enough to be a big risk.</p>
<p>I think it'd be a great thing to see more fusors in children's museums
(and other science museums). They don't have to turn it on; it'd just
be a cool exhibit to demonstrate that it's so possible.</p>

<title>Give the model epistemology</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Jaskie has a nice paper with
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9048765">A Modified Logistic Regression for Positive and Unlabeled Learning</a>.
I like that it extends the usual logistic function in a way that
captures the idea that labels may be incorrect. I wonder about
extending the idea to multi-class softmax, and its relationship with
label smoothing.</p>
<p>Here's the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic function</a>.</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ 1 }{ 1 + e^{-x} } \tag{1} \]</p>
<p>What Jaskie does is introduce another term in the denominator:</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ 1 }{ 1 + b^2 + e^{-x} } \tag{2} \]</p>
<p>The \( b \) term is squared to be non-negative, and learned during
model fitting. The effect is that the maximum score for a positive
example is less than one.</p>
<p>This makes sense in the positive unlabeled setting because Jaskie
differentiates between whether an example <em>is</em> positive and whether an
example is <em>labeled</em> positive. We only have the labels, and we know
that some positive examples may not be positively labeled, so the
probability based on the example that it is positively labeled is less
than one.</p>
<p>It's somewhat surprising that this seems to work quite well, as
demonstrated (for example) in Jaskie's Figure 6. (SLR is Standard
Logistic Regression, MLR is Jaskie's Modified Logistic Regression.)</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 6" src="figure_6.png"></p>
<p>Let's speculate about extending this idea to the multi-class setting.
First, just moving things around, Equation 2 becomes Equation 3.</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ e^x }{ (1 + b^2) e^x + 1 } \tag{3} \]</p>
<p>That form makes it easy to see the analogy between the usual logistic
function and the multi-class <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">softmax</a>. Then the natural thing to
suggest is Equation 4.</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ e^{x_i} }{ \sum (1 + b_i^2) e^{x_i} } \tag{4} \]</p>
<p>The semi-supervised setting in which there's a pile of unlabeled data
in addition to the labeled data is pretty common, especially when
labeling is expensive, and if something relatively simple like this
were to give similar performance benefits to Jaskie's binary case, it
could easily become very popular. (Assume you have a "garbage" class
as well, in the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/task/open-set-learning">open set</a> sense.)</p>
<p>There's probably a similar extension to keep the negative example
scores from going all the way to zero, if you think some of the true
negatives might have incorrectly positive labels (or otherwise wrong
labels in the multi-class setting).</p>
<p>I wonder about the relationship between these techniques and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02629">label smoothing</a>... With smoothed labels you still have fixed (or
at least sort of balanced) target probabilities, whereas the above
techniques allow learning where the targets should be... But I think
you wouldn't get the limits on logit growth, with the above
techniques... It would be neat if the above techniques gave you good
calibration <em>and</em> informative logits in the distillation sense. Hmm!</p>

<title>Drawbridge Up, by Enzensberger</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Drawbridge-Up-Mathematics-Cultural-Anathema/dp/156881156X">talk</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Magnus_Enzensberger">the author of The Number Devil</a> is unfortunately
hard to find at a reasonable price. It's a beautiful short version of
the not uncommon sentiment that math should be more widely
appreciated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Short: Drawbridge Up, by Enzensberger</li>
<li>Medium: <a href="/20200909-mathematicians_lament_by_lockhart/">A Mathematician's Lament, by Lockhart</a></li>
<li>Long: <a href="//20200925-how_not_to_be_wrong_by_ellenberg/">How Not to Be Wrong, by Ellenberg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mumford">Mumford</a>'s preface is <a href="https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/beyond/education.html">available</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am accustomed, as a professional mathematician, to living in a
sort of vacuum, surrounded by people who, as in the first paragraph
of Enzensberger's essay, declare with an odd sort of pride that they
are mathematically illiterate. How astonishing to come to the
International Congress and find a distinguished poet and essayist
who analyzes this problem with such a deep understanding and
sensitivity. This is a beautiful essay and great delight for a
mathematician to read. Here the strange contradictions with which we
live are laid bare with accuracy of a dissecting microscope. He is
onto our schizophrenic world in which, with one hand, we take pride
in building an elegant world utterly divorced from the demands of
reality and, with the other, claim that our ideas underlie virtually
all technological developments of significance. I was particularly
pleased to find that he believes progress is possible in teaching
mathematics, that it can be made exciting to young minds. I tried
(unsuccessfully) to get each high school in which my children were
enrolled to go outside during geometry class and find out how tall
the oak in the yard really is. Instead they buckled under to the
establishment and even removed that staple of my generation: the odd
formulaic Euclidean-style proof in which the pedigree of each step
was detailed. This old game, the one piece of high school
mathematics often mentioned warmly by people who otherwise hated
math, had been found wanting by the mathematical puritans described
in the Stewart quote, where the mathematician is unwilling to "lie a
bit, like everyone else does". I hope the right people read this
essay -- the movers and shakers of school curricula -- and that it
moves them to let a hundred flowers bloom in the classroom."</p>

<title>Definitional and Computational Sum of Squares are equal</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The definitional (or conceptual) and computational forms of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_sum_of_squares">sum of squared deviations from the mean</a> are equivalent, as in
Equation 1.</p>
<p>\[ SS = \sum \left( x - \overline{x} \right)^2 =
         \sum x^2 - \frac{ \left( \sum x \right)^2 }{ N } \tag{1} \]</p>
<p>We have \( N \) numbers \( x_i \). Their mean is \( \overline{x} \).</p>
<p>\[ \overline{x} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i }{ N }  \tag{2} \]</p>
<p>The limits of every sum here are the same, and always range over the
numbers \( x_i \), so the limits and subscript \( i \) are not
shown outside of Equation 2.</p>
<p>The sum of squared deviations from the mean is defined as in Equation
1.</p>
<p>\[ \sum \left( x - \overline{x} \right)^2 \tag{3} \]</p>
<p>Distributing and rearranging, Expression 3 is the same as Expression
4.</p>
<p>\[ \sum \left( x^2 + \overline{x} \left( \overline{x} - 2x \right) \right) \tag{4} \]</p>
<p>Considering the properties of sums, Expression 4 can be re-written as
Expression 5.</p>
<p>\[ \sum x^2 + \overline{x} \left( \sum \overline{x} -2 \sum x \right) \tag{5} \]</p>
<p>The mean \( \overline{x} \) is a constant, so summing over it gives
\( N \overline{x} \). As can be seen from Equation 2, the sum over
\( x \) is also \( N \overline{x} \). Using these, Expression 5
becomes Expression 6.</p>
<p>\[ \sum x^2 - N \overline{x}^2 \tag{6} \]</p>
<p>Replacing the mean \( \overline{x} \) with its definition as in
Equation 2, we arrive at the computational form.</p>
<p>\[ \sum x^2 - \frac{ \left( \sum x \right)^2 }{ N } \tag{7} \]</p>
<p>Expression 3 and Expression 7 are therefore equal, as shown in
Equation 1. \( \blacksquare \)</p>
<hr>
<p>I thought about writing this up years ago; here's an old
<a href="old.html">draft</a>. I referred to McDowell's <a href="http://psychology.emory.edu/clinical/mcdowell/PSYCH560/Basics/var.html">derivation</a> (nominally
for variance) in writing the above. The computational form is nice
especially if you're calculating by hand, and is (has been?) sometimes
<a href="http://www.ablongman.com/graziano6e/text_site/MATERIAL/Stats/manvar.htm">taught</a> as a procedure, sort of like long division. I don't think
teaching that is really a good idea, if what you care about is
teaching statistics, but it could be a neat example in the right kind
of course on implementation of algorithms (applied math or CS,
maybe?).</p>

<title>AI Superpowers, by Lee</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>There's a lot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai-Fu_Lee">Kai-fu Lee</a> isn't wrong about in <a href="https://www.aisuperpowers.com/">AI Superpowers</a>.
The major break-through of deep learning has occurred, and
applications are now more engineering than invention (cf. <a href="/20200728-technological_revolutions_and_financial_capital/">Perez</a>).
China has data, entrepreneurs, engineers, and government support for
AI. Compared to the US, China has fewer ethical qualms and democratic
controls, which Lee propagandizes as advantages for China. I think
he's right that we should worry more about human society than about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a>, but I think he exaggerates the exceptionalism of AI.</p>
<p>The boundary between AI and non-AI computing isn't clear. There have
been industrial robots for years. Does it matter whether Google search
is powered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)">BERT</a>? It's hard to pin down exactly
what's AI and what isn't. But this isn't my main objection.</p>
<p>There has <em>already been</em> a trend toward concentration of corporate
power, economic inequality, and unemployment/underemployment. The main
problem with Harari's "<a href="https://ideas.ted.com/the-rise-of-the-useless-class/">useless class</a>" idea is his use of the
future tense. The useless class is here already.</p>
<p>It might be better to discuss issues of the future of society in
connections with AI rather than not at all, but I worry that the focus
on AI can distract from trends and approaches that aren't tied to AI.
It isn't useful to make new AI a scapegoat for existing phenomena.</p>
<p>I think Lee overestimates the magnitude of AI's direct impact on jobs,
but maybe not the magnitude of the overall trend in jobs. Regardless,
he then spends the back of the book opining on public policy after his
come-to-Jesus (not literally) experience with cancer. He praises
volunteers and then proposes that we must pay people for things they
would volunteer to do if they didn't have to worry about money. I
don't oppose paying teachers (etc.) more, but I think he's
fundamentally wrong about how humans work, and I think he's way
outside his area of expertise.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Selected quotes and (rarely) commentary</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In my view, that [Chinese/US] lead in AI development will translate
into productivity gains on a scale not seen since the Industrial
Revolution." (page 18)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Based on the current trends in technology advancement and adoption,
I predict that within fifteen years, artificial intelligence will
technically be able to replace around 40 to 50 percent of jobs in
the United States. Actual job losses may end up lagging those
technical capabilities by an additional decade, but I forecast that
the disruption to job markets will be very real, very large, and
coming soon." (page 19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Published in 2018, so that's capability by 2033 and job losses by
2043.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The AI world order will combine winner-take-all economics with an
unprecedented concentration of wealth in the hands of a few
companies in China and the United States. This, I believe, is the
real underlying threat posed by artificial intelligence: tremendous
social disorder and political collapse stemming from widespread
unemployment and gaping inequality." (page 21)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Entry into the country's imperial bureaucracy depended on
word-for-word memorization of ancient texts and the ability to
construct a perfect "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-legged_essay">eight-legged essay</a>" following rigid
stylistic guidelines." (page 27)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"But what these critics miss is that this process
[of Chinese central government support] can be both highly
inefficient and extraordinarily effective." (page 65)</p>

of migrant laborers who would gladly bring that service to their

<p>AI is "the defining technology of the twenty-first century." (page
80)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"As I laid out earlier, creating an AI superpower for the
twenty-first century requires four main building blocks: abundant
data, tenacious entrepreneurs, well-trained AI scientists, and a
supportive policy environment." (page 82)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The complete AI revolution will take a little time and will
ultimately wash over us in a series of four waves: internet AI,
business AI, perception AI, and autonomous AI." (page 105)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"And judicial biases can be far less malicious than racism: a study
of Israeli judges found them far more severe in their decision
before lunch and more lenient in granting parole after having a good
meal." (page 116)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if this well-known judge study were replicated and broadly
believed (which it is <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/impossibly-hungry-judges">not</a>), Lee's reference is still rather
appalling excuse-making for racist algorithms.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Chinese and American internet companies have taken different
approaches to winning local markets,
[China supporting local companies, America expanding into markets directly]
and as these AI services filter out to every corner of the world,
they may engage in proxy competition in countries like India,
Indonesia, and parts of the Middle East and Africa." (page 139)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We looked at technical fixes that seek to smooth the transition to
an AI economy: retraining workers, reducing work hours, and
redistributing income through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income">UBI</a>. While all of these
technical fixes have a role to play, I believe something more is
needed. I envision the private sector creatively fostering
human-machine symbiosis, a new wave of impact investing funding
human-centric service jobs, and the government filling the gaps with
a social investment stipend that rewards care, service, and
education." (page 224-225)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In revamping our education systems, we can learn much from South
Korea's embrace of gifted and talented education. These programs

<title>How Not to Be Wrong, by Ellenberg</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I like <a href="https://www.jordanellenberg.com/how-not-to-be-wrong/">this book</a> a lot. The five parts (Linearity, Inference,
Expectation, Regression, Existence) provide beautiful large-scale
structure, and it also shimmers on every page. Supreme Court justices
encounter the word "orthogonal." There's a beautiful proof of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem">Buffon's needle problem</a>. There's some philosophy of math.
Ellenberg is a delight.</p>
<p>In some ways, How Not to Be Wrong is like a long version of
<a href="/20200909-mathematicians_lament_by_lockhart/">Lockhart's exultation</a>, with examples. Lockhart extols the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion">method of exhaustion</a>; Ellenberg teaches it. The author clearly
loves math, and shares it generously with the reader.</p>
<p>The "How Not to Be Wrong" is delivered by exposing numerous common
fallacies or errors in understanding. Not every phenomenon is linear.
"Don't talk about percentages of numbers when the numbers might be
negative." "Improbable things happen a lot," and that affects how you
should think about significance tests and related things. The book is
a joy to read, I'd also read a "handbook" version collecting just the
main ideas.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Selected quotations and (rarely) comments</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Those [homework] integrals are to mathematics as weight training
and calisthenics are to soccer. If you want to play soccer&#8212;I mean,

boring, repetitive, apparently pointless drills." (page 2)</p>

&#8220;Addition is commutative.&#8221;" (page 11)</p>

<p>"We tend to teach mathematics as a long list of rules. You learn
them in order and you have to obey them, because if you don&#8217;t obey
them you get a C-. <em>This is not mathematics.</em> Mathematics is the
study of things that come out a certain way because there is no
other way they could possibly be." (page 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The specialized language in which mathematicians converse with one
another is a magnificent tool for conveying complex ideas precisely

Galileo are <em>never actually right</em>. I get letters with this kind of
language at least once a month, usually from people who have
&#8220;proofs&#8221; of mathematical statements that have been known for
hundreds of years to be false. I can guarantee you Einstein did not
go around telling people, &#8220;Look, I know this theory of general
relativity sounds wacky, but that's what they said about Galileo!&#8221;)"

<p>"Working an integral or performing a linear regression is something
a computer can do quite effectively. Understanding whether the
result makes sense&#8212;or deciding whether the method is the right one
to use in the first place&#8212;requires a guiding human hand. When we
teach mathematics we are supposed to be explaining how to be that

student is &#8220;I get the concept, but I couldn't do the problems.&#8221;
Though the student doesn't know it, this is shorthand for &#8220;I don't
get the concept.&#8221; The ideas of mathematics can sound abstract, but
they make sense only in reference to concrete computations. William
Carlos Williams put it crisply: <em>no ideas but in things</em>." (page 58)</p>

<title>Trivia rewards test-time effort</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I've been a casual <a href="https://www.learnedleague.com/">LearnedLeague</a> trivia player for a while. I was
inspired by <a href="/20200716-lateral_thinking_creativity_step_by_step/">Lateral Thinking</a> (the book) to try typing out
"conversations with myself" as I thought about the questions during
season 86. I didn't study or change anything else. Directing effort
during question-answering seems to have helped me answer more
questions correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#sure">Am I sure I did better?</a></li>
<li><a href="#diff">What did I do differently?</a></li>
<li><a href="#obvious">Is the benefit of effort obvious?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="SchumacherA correct answers per season" src="tca.png"></p>
<p><em>There are four LearnedLeague seasons per year, each with 25 match
days of 6 questions each. My performance has ranged from 34 to 66
correct out of 150, or 22.7% to 44.0% correct.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="sure"></a>Am I sure I did better?</h3>
<p>A change in question difficulty could also lead to me getting more
right. I've been in Rundle E for all the seasons shown, which means
I'm in with a bunch of other casual players. Since the mix of people
isn't likely to suddenly change, the performance of my opponents is a
rough control for question difficulty. Looking at the difference
between my number of correct answers and my opponents', the season 86
improvement is still clear.</p>
<p><img alt="SchumacherA correct answer differential per season" src="cadiff.png"></p>
<p>Looking at the league-wide correct answer percentage, it does seem
that this season was slightly easier than last season, but the
difference is small (50.71% vs. 49.06%). There are fancier ways to try
to control for question difficulty, but I'm satisfied that the change
in my performance isn't primarily due to changes in question
difficulty.</p>
<p>I also don't think the change is explained by a gradual process of
natural learning over time. I don't see any compelling pattern in the
first fifteen data points.</p>
<p>If you assume the earlier 15 season results were samples from the same
distribution, my season 86 result is very unlikely to arise from that
distribution by chance (p-value well under 0.01) for either view of
the data. (<a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/blob/master/20200924-trivia_rewards_effort/analyze.ipynb">calculations</a>)</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="diff"></a>What did I do differently?</h3>
<p>Previously, I'd look at the questions online, think about them, and
write in my answers. For season 86, I inserted an extra step. I copied
the questions into a text file on my computer, and I typed out my
thinking process, using lots of question marks and thinking of lots of
related things, even sometimes free-associating.</p>
<p>Here's an example <a href="https://www.learnedleague.com/question.php?86&amp;7&amp;1">question</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decade of chaos and political upheaval in China that began in
1966, grounded in a factional conflict over the future of Chinese
socialism, and ended with Mao's death in 1976, is best known in the
west as what "Revolution"?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not a hard question, but I didn't remember the answer at first.
In fact, I had a wrong answer that I was nearly ready to use. Here's
what I wrote in my file:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Children's? Somehow I think "Children's Revolution"... Was that
something from 3 Body Problem? Seems like a weird revolution name.
What else... Green Revolution was/is a big agriculture thing... That
other Chinese thing is "The Great Leap Forward" when lots of people
died... Mao's Revolution? People's Revolution? Socialist Revolution?
Weird Revolution? Party Revolution? Dance Dance Revolution? Red
Revolution? "It was known in the west as the ..." Decade? 10-year
Revolution? Slow revolution? Is it named after a leader? Other than
Mao? Cultural Revolution? Hmm... That sounds right somehow. Great
Leap Forward, Cultural Revolution... both of those sound like
history things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took me a while to finally get to the right answer. If I hadn't
been writing things out like this, I might have just written down my
first guess. There were many questions like this, when I felt like the
extra process helped me get to a correct answer.</p>
<p>The extra process also led to me getting more mentally and emotionally
involved in the season. I felt like I was doing a little bit better,
and it made me care more. A seemingly mechanical task change ended up
increasing my motivation.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="obvious"></a>Is the benefit of effort obvious?</h3>
<p>In the extreme, low effort can lead to scores of zero, so effort
certainly has some effect. But I've never "blown off" LearnedLeague;
I've always tried to answer as best I can. So the possibly surprising
thing is that I was able to improve markedly from that baseline.</p>
<p>Trivia is pretty close to a pure knowledge test: "either you know it
or you don't." It isn't surprising that performance improves with
study in advance, and it isn't surprising that performance varies by
person based on strength of memory, etc. But it might be surprising
that performance can vary for an individual, depending on approach
during the test itself.</p>
<p>If performance changes measurably on a task like this, how much more
so for process tasks like mathematics? How large must be the
contribution to a student's standardized test scores from motivation
and focus on a particular day?</p>
<p>On the other hand, the observed effect doesn't move me at all into the
ranks of the strongest competitors on LearnedLeague, who routinely get
70% of questions correct, compared to my new record of 44%.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the effect is large enough that it seems like it
matters, and it certainly matters psychologically to me. Something
like a <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">growth mindset</a>, it motivates me a lot more to think about
LearnedLeague as something that responds to effort, rather than just a
test of what I happen to know... It's more like climbing a rope than
checking oil with a dipstick. (More like climbing a rope than
measuring a rope? I'm liking this image...)</p>

<title>Axiomatic Thinking (Hilbert, 1918)</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I had difficulty finding this online, so I'm posting it here for
reference.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="#1" name="1">&#182;</a> Just as in the life of nations the
individual nation can only thrive when all neighbouring nations are in
good health; and just as the interest of states demands, not only that
order prevail within every individual state, but also that the
relationships of the states among themselves be in good order; so it
is in the life of the sciences. In due recognition of this fact the
most important bearers of mathematical thought have always evinced
great interest in the laws and the structure of the neighbouring
sciences; above all for the benefit of mathematics itself they have
always cultivated the relations to the neighbouring sciences,
especially to the great empires of physics and epistemology. I believe
that the essence of these relations, and the reason for their
fruitfulness, will appear most clearly if I describe for you the
general method of research which seems to be coming more and more into
its own in modern mathematics: I mean the <em>axiomatic method</em>.</p>
<p><a href="#2" name="2">&#182;</a> When we assemble the facts of a definite,
more-or-less comprehensive field of knowledge, we soon notice that
these facts are capable of being ordered. This ordering always comes
about with the help of a certain <em>framework of concepts</em>
[<em>Fachwerk von Begriffen</em>] in the following way: a concept of this
framework corresponds to each individual object of the field of
knowledge, and a logical relation between concepts corresponds to
every fact within the field of knowledge. The framework of concepts is
nothing other than the <em>theory</em> of the field of knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="#3" name="3">&#182;</a> Thus the facts of geometry order
themselves into a geometry, the facts of arithmetic into a theory of
numbers, the facts of statics, mechanics, electrodynamics into a
theory of statics, mechanics, electrodynamics, or the facts from the
physics of gases into a theory of gases. It is precisely the same with
the fields of knowledge of thermodynamics, geometrical optics,
elementary radiation-theory, the conduction of heat, or also with the
calculus of probabilities or the theory of sets. It even holds of
special fields of knowledge in pure mathematics, such as the theory of
surfaces, the theory of Galois equations, and the theory of prime
numbers, no less than for several fields of knowledge that lie far
from mathematics, such as certain parts of psychophysics or the theory
of money.</p>
<p><a href="#4" name="4">&#182;</a> If we consider a particular theory more
closely, we always see that a few distinguished propositions of the
field of knowledge underlie the construction of the framework of
concepts, and these propositions then suffice by themselves for the
construction, in accordance with logical principles, of the entire
framework.</p>
<p><a href="#5" name="5">&#182;</a> Thus in geometry the proposition of the
linearity of the equation of the plane and of the orthogonal
transformation of point-coordinates is completely adequate to produce
the whole broad science of spatial Euclidean geometry purely by means
of analysis. Moreover, the laws of calculation and the rules for
integers suffice for the construction of number theory. In statics the
same role is played by the proposition of the parallelogram of forces;
in mechanics, say, by the Lagrangian differential equations of motion;
and in electrodynamics by the Maxwell equations together with the
requirement of the rigidity and charge of the electron. Thermodynamics
can be completely built up from the concept of energy function and the
definition of temperature and pressure as derivatives of its
variables, entropy and volume. At the heart of the elementary theory
of radiation is Kirchhoff's theorem on the relationships between
emission and absorption; in the calculus of probabilities the Gaussian
law of errors is the fundamental proposition; in the theory of gases,
the proposition that entropy is the negative logarithm of the
probability of the state; in the theory of surfaces, the
representation of the element of arc by the quadratic differential
form; in the theory of equations, the proposition concerning the
existence of roots; in the theory of prime numbers, the proposition
concerning the reality and frequency of Rieman's function &#120577;(s).</p>
<p><a href="#6" name="6">&#182;</a> These fundamental propositions can be
regarded from an initial standpoint as the <em>axioms of the individual
fields of knowledge</em>: the progressive development of the individual
field of knowledge then lies solely in the further logical
construction of the already mentioned framework of concepts. This
standpoint is especially predominant in pure mathematics, and to the
corresponding manner of working we owe the mighty development of
geometry, of arithmetic, of the theory of functions, and of the whole
of analysis.</p>
<p><a href="#7" name="7">&#182;</a> Thus in the cases mentioned above the
problem of grounding the individual field of knowledge had found a
solution; but this solution was only temporary. In fact, in the
individual fields of knowledge the need arose to ground the
fundamental axiomatic propositions themselves. So one acquired
'proofs' of the linearity of the equation of the plane and the
orthogonality of the transformation expressing a movement, of the laws
of arithmetical calculation, of the parallelogram of forces, of the
Lagrangian equations of motion, of Kirchhoff's law regarding emission
and absorption, of the law of entropy, and of the proposition
concerning the existence of roots of an equation.</p>
<p><a href="#8" name="8">&#182;</a> But critical examination of these 'proofs'
shows that they are not in themselves proofs, but basically only make
it possible to trace things back to certain deeper propositions, which
in turn are now to be regarded as new axioms instead of the
propositions to be proved. The actual so-called <em>axioms</em> of geometry,
arithmetic, statics, mechanics, radiation theory, or thermodynamics
arose in this way. These axioms form a layer of axioms which lies
deeper than the axiom-layer given by the recently-mentioned
fundamental theorems of the individual field of knowledge. The
procedure of the axiomatic method, as it is expressed here, amounts to
a <em>deepening of the foundations</em> of the individual domains of
knowledge&#8212;a deepening that is necessary for every edifice that one
wishes to expand and to build higher while preserving its stability.</p>
<p><a href="#9" name="9">&#182;</a> If the theory of a field of knowledge&#8212;that
is, the framework of concepts that represents it&#8212;is to serve its
purpose of orienting and ordering, then it must satisfy two
requirements above all: <em>first</em> it should give us an overview of the
<em>independence</em> and <em>dependence</em> of the propositions of the theory;
<em>second</em>, it should give us a guarantee of the <em>consistency</em> of all
the propositions of the theory. In particular, the axioms of each
theory are to be examined from these two points of view.</p>
<p><a href="#10" name="10">&#182;</a> Let us first consider the independence
or dependence of the axioms.</p>
<p><a href="#11" name="11">&#182;</a> The <em>axiom of parallels</em> in geometry is
the classical example of the independence of an axiom. When he placed
the parallel postulate among the axioms, Euclid thereby denied that
the proposition of parallels is implied by the other axioms. Euclid's
method of investigation became the paradigm for axiomatic research,
and since Euclid geometry has been the prime example of an axiomatic
science.</p>
<p><a href="#12" name="12">&#182;</a> Classical mechanics furnishes another
example of an investigation of the independence of axioms. The
Lagrangian equations of motion were temporarily able to count as
axioms of mechanics&#8212;for mechanics can of course be entirely based on
these equations when they are generally formulated for arbitrary
forces and arbitrary side-constraints. But further investigation shows
that it is not necessary in the construction of mechanics to
presuppose arbitrary forces or arbitrary side-constraints; thus the
system of presuppositions can be reduced. This piece of knowledge
leads, on the one hand, to the axiom system of Boltzmann, who assumes
only forces (and indeed special central forces) but no
side-constraints, and the axiom system of Hertz, who discards forces
and makes do with side-constraints (and indeed special
side-constraints with rigid connections). These two axiom systems form
a deeper layer in the progressive axiomatization of mechanics.</p>
<p><a href="#13" name="13">&#182;</a> If in establishing the theory of Galois
equations we assume as an axiom the existence of roots of an equation,
then this is certainly a dependent axiom; for, as Gauss was the first
to show, that existence theorem can be proved from the axioms of
arithmetic.</p>
<p><a href="#14" name="14">&#182;</a> Something similar would happen if we
were to assume as an axiom in the theory of prime numbers the
proposition about the reality of the zeroes of the Riemann
&#120577;(s)-function: as we progress to a deeper layer of purely arithmetical
axioms the proof of this reality-proposition would become necessary,
and only this proof would guarantee the reliability of the important
conclusions which we have already achieved for the theory of prime
numbers by taking it as a postulate.</p>
<p><a href="#15" name="15">&#182;</a> A particularly interesting question for
axiomatics concerns the independence of the propositions of a field of
knowledge from the axiom of <em>continuity</em>.</p>
<p><a href="#16" name="16">&#182;</a> In the theory of real numbers it is
shown that the axiom of measurement&#8212;the so-called Archimedean axiom&#8212;is
independent of all the other arithmetical axioms. As everybody knows,
this information is of great significance for geometry; but it seems
to me to be of capital interest for physics as well, for it leads to
the following result: the fact that by adjoining terrestrial distances
to one another we can achieve the dimensions and distances of bodies
in outer space (that is, that we can measure heavenly distances with
an earthly yardstick) and the fact that the distances within an atom
can all be expressed in terms of metres&#8212;these facts are not at all a
mere logical consequence of propositions about the congruence of
triangles or about geometric configurations, but are a result of
empirical research. The validity of the Archimedean axiom in nature
stands in just as much need of confirmation by experiment as does the
familiar proposition about the sum of the angles of a triangle.</p>
<p><a href="#17" name="17">&#182;</a> In general, I should like to formulate
the axiom of continuity in physics as follows: 'If for the validity of
a proposition of physics we prescribe any degree of accuracy
whatsoever, then it is possible to indicate small regions within which
the presuppositions that have been made for the proposition may vary
freely, without the deviation of the proposition exceeding the
prescribed degree of accuracy.' This axiom basically does nothing more
than express something that already lies in the essence of experiment;
it is constantly presupposed by the physicists, although it has not
previously been formulated.</p>
<p><a href="#18" name="18">&#182;</a> For example, if one follows Planck and
derives the second law of thermodynamics from the axiom of the
impossibility of a <em>perpetuum mobile of the second sort</em>, then this
axiom of continuity must be used in the derivation.</p>
<p><a href="#19" name="19">&#182;</a> By invoking the theorem that the
continuum can be well-ordered, Hamel has shown in a most interesting
manner that, in the foundations of statics, the axiom of continuity is
necessary for the proof of the theorem concerning the <em>parallelogram
of forces</em>&#8212;at any rate, given the most obvious choice of other axioms.</p>
<p><a href="#20" name="20">&#182;</a> The axioms of classical mechanics can be
deepened if, using the axiom of continuity, one imagines continuous
motion to be decomposed into small straight-line movements caused by
discrete impulses and following one another in rapid succession. One
then applies Bertrand's maximum principle as the essential axiom of
mechanics, according to which the motion that actually occurs after
each impulse is that which maximizes the kinetic energy of the system
with respect to all motions that are compatible with the law of the
conservation of energy.</p>
<p><a href="#21" name="21">&#182;</a> The most recent ways of laying the
foundations of physics&#8212;of electrodynamics in particular&#8212;are all
theories of the continuum, and therefore raise the demand for
continuity in the most extreme fashion. But I should prefer not to
discuss them because the investigations are not yet completed.</p>
<p><a href="#22" name="22">&#182;</a> We shall now examine the second of the
two points of view mentioned above, namely, the question concerning
the <em>consistency</em> of the axioms. This question is obviously of the
greatest importance, for the presence of a contradiction in a theory
manifestly threatens the contents of the entire theory.</p>
<p><a href="#23" name="23">&#182;</a> Even for successful theories that have
long been accepted, it is difficult to know that they are internally
consistent: I remind you of the reversibility and recurrence paradox
in the kinetic theory of gases.</p>
<p><a href="#24" name="24">&#182;</a> It often happens that the internal
consistency of a theory is regarded as obvious, while in reality the
proof requires deep mathematical developments. For example, consider a
problem from the elementary theory of the <em>conduction of heat</em>&#8212;namely,
the distribution of temperatures within a homogeneous body whose
surfaces are maintained at a definite temperature that varies from
place to place: then in fact the requirement that there be an
equilibrium of temperatures involves no internal theoretical
contradiction. But to know this it is necessary to prove that the
familiar boundary-value problem of potential theory is always
solvable; for only this proof shows that a temperature distribution
satisfying the equations of the conduction of heat is at all possible.</p>
<p><a href="#25" name="25">&#182;</a> But particularly in physics it is not
sufficient that the propositions of a theory be in harmony with each
other; there remains the requirement that they not contradict the
propositions of a neighbouring field of knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="#26" name="26">&#182;</a> Thus, as I showed earlier, the axioms of
the elementary theory of radiation can be used to prove not only
<em>Kirchhoff's law</em> of emission and absorption, but also a special law
about the reflection and refraction of individual beams of light,
namely, the law: If two beams of natural light and of the same energy
each fall on the surface separating two media from different sides in
such a way that one beam after its reflection, and the other after its
passage, each have the same direction, then the beam that arises from
uniting the two is also of natural light and of the same energy. This
theorem is, as the facts show, not at all in contradiction with
optics, but can be derived as a conclusion from the electromagnetic
theory of light.</p>
<p><a href="#27" name="27">&#182;</a> As is well known, the results of the
<em>kinetic theory of gases</em> are in full harmony with thermodynamics.</p>
<p><a href="#28" name="28">&#182;</a> Similarly, <em>electrodynamic inertia</em> and
<em>Einsteinian gravitation</em> are compatible with the corresponding
concepts of the classical theories, since the classical concepts can
be conceived as limiting cases of the more general concepts in the new
theories.</p>
<p><a href="#29" name="29">&#182;</a> In contrast, <em>modern quantum theory</em> and
our developing knowledge of the internal structure of the atom have
led to laws which virtually contradict the earlier electrodynamics,
which was essentially built on the Maxwell equations; modern
electrodynamics therefore needs&#8212;as everybody acknowledges&#8212;a new
foundation and essential reformulation.</p>
<p><a href="#30" name="30">&#182;</a> As one can see from what has already
been said, the contradictions that arise in physical theories are
always eliminated by changing the selection of the axioms; the
difficulty is to make the selection so that all the observed physical
laws are logical consequences of the chosen axioms.</p>
<p><a href="#31" name="31">&#182;</a> But matters are different when
contradictions appear in purely theoretical fields of knowledge. Set
theory contains the classic example of such an occurrence, namely, in
the <em>paradox of the set of all sets</em>, which goes back to Cantor. This
paradox is so serious that distinguished mathematicians, for example,
Kronecker and Poincar&#233;, felt compelled by it to deny that set
theory&#8212;one of the most fruitful and powerful branches of knowledge
anywhere in mathematics&#8212;has any justification for existing.</p>
<p><a href="#32" name="32">&#182;</a> But in this precarious state of affairs
as well, the axiomatic method came to the rescue. By setting up
appropriate axioms which in a precise way restricted both the
arbitrariness of the definitions of sets and the admissibility of
statements about their elements, Zermelo succeeded in developing set
theory in such a way that the contradictions disappear, but the scope
and applicability of set theory remain the same.</p>
<p><a href="#33" name="33">&#182;</a> In all previous cases it was a matter of
contradictions that had emerged in the course of the development of a
theory and that needed to be eliminated by a reformulation of the
axiom system. But if we wish to restore the reputation of mathematics
as the exemplar of the most rigorous science it is not enough merely
to avoid the existing contradictions. The chief requirement of the
theory of axioms must go farther, namely, to show that within every
field of knowledge contradictions based on the underlying axiom-system
are <em>absolutely impossible</em>.</p>
<p><a href="#34" name="34">&#182;</a> In accordance with this requirement I
have proved the consistency of the axioms laid down in the <em>Grundlagen
der Geometrie</em> by showing that any contradiction in the consequences
of the geometrical axioms must necessarily apppear in the arithmetic
of the system of real numbers as well.</p>
<p><a href="#35" name="35">&#182;</a> For the fields of physical knowledge
too, it is clearly sufficient to reduce the problem of <em>internal
consistency</em> to the consistency of the arithmetical axioms. Thus I
showed the consistency of the axioms of the <em>elementary theory of
radiation</em> by constructing its axiom system out of analytically
independent pieces&#8212;presupposing in the process the consistency of
analysis.</p>
<p><a href="#36" name="36">&#182;</a> One may and should in some circumstances
proceed similarly in the construction of a mathematical theory. For
example, if in the development of the theory of Galois groups we have
taken the proposition of the <em>existence of roots</em> as an axiom, or if
in the theory of prime numbers we have taken the hypothesis concerning
the <em>reality of the zeros</em> of the Riemann &#120577;(s)-function as an axiom,
then in each case the proof of the consistency of the axiom system
comes down to a proof, using the means of analysis, of the proposition
of the existence of roots or of the Riemann hypothesis concerning
&#120577;(s)&#8212;and only then has the theory been securely completed.</p>
<p><a href="#37" name="37">&#182;</a> The problem of the consistency of the
axiom system for the <em>real numbers</em> can likewise be reduced by the use
of set-theoretic concepts to the same problem for the integers: this
is the merit of the theories of the irrational numbers developed by
Weierstrass and Dedekind.</p>
<p><a href="#38" name="38">&#182;</a> In only two cases is this method of
reduction to another special domain of knowledge clearly not
available, namely, when it is a matter of the axioms for the
<em>integers</em> themselves, and when it is a matter of the foundation of
<em>set theory</em>; for here there is no other discipline besides logic
which it would be possi-ble to invoke.</p>
<p><a href="#39" name="39">&#182;</a> But since the examination of consistency
is a task that cannot be avoided, it appears necessary to axiomatize
logic itself and to prove that number theory and set theory are only
parts of logic.</p>
<p><a href="#40" name="40">&#182;</a> This method was prepared long ago (not
least by Frege's profound investigations); it has been most
successfully explained by the acute mathematician and logician
Russell. One could regard the completion of this magnificent
Russellian enterprise of the <em>axiomatization of logic</em> as the crowning
achievement of the work of axiomatization as a whole.</p>
<p><a href="#41" name="41">&#182;</a> But this completion will require further
work. When we consider the matter more closely we soon recognize that
the question of the consistency of the integers and of sets is not one
that stands alone, but that it belongs to a vast domain of difficult
epistemological questions which have a specifically mathematical tint:
for example (to characterize this domain of questions briefly) the
problem of the <em>solvability in principle of every mathematical
question</em>, the problem of the subsequent <em>checkability</em> of the results
of a mathematical investigation, the question of a <em>criterion of
simplicity</em> for mathematical proofs, the question of the relationship
between <em>content and formalism</em> in mathematics and logic, and finally
the problem of the <em>decidability</em> of a mathematical question in a
finite number of operations.</p>
<p><a href="#42" name="42">&#182;</a> We cannot rest content with the
axiomatization of logic until all questions of this sort and their
interconnections have been understood and cleared up.</p>
<p><a href="#43" name="43">&#182;</a> Among the mentioned questions, the
last&#8212;namely, the one concerning decidability in a finite number of
operations&#8212;is the best-known and the most discussed; for it goes to
the essence of mathematical thought.</p>
<p><a href="#44" name="44">&#182;</a> I should like to increase the interest
in this question by indicating several particular mathematical
problems in which it plays a role.</p>
<p><a href="#45" name="45">&#182;</a> In the theory of <em>algebraic invariants</em>
we have the fundamental theorem that there is always a finite number
of whole rational invariants by means of which all other such
invariants can be represented. In my opinion, my first general proof
of this theorem completely satisfied our requirements of simplicity
and perspicuity; but it is impossible to reformulate this proof so
that we can obtain from it a statable bound for the number of the
finitely many invariants of the full system, let alone obtain an
actual listing of them. Instead, new principles and considerations of
a completely different sort were necessary in order to show that the
construction of the full system of invariants requires only a finite
number of operations, and that this number is less than a bound that
can be stated before the calculation.</p>
<p><a href="#46" name="46">&#182;</a> We see the same thing happening in an
example from the <em>theory of surfaces</em>. It is a fundamental question in
the geometry of surfaces of the fourth order to determine the maximum
number of separate sheets it takes to make up such a surface.</p>
<p><a href="#47" name="47">&#182;</a> The first step towards an answer to this
question is the proof that the number of sheets of a curved surface
must be finite. This can easily be shown function-theoretically as
follows. One assumes the existence of infinitely many sheets, and
selects a point inside each spatial region bounded by a sheet. A point
of accumulation for these infinitely many chosen points would then be
a point of a singularity that is excluded for an algebraic surface.</p>
<p><a href="#48" name="48">&#182;</a> This function-theoretic path does not at
all lead to an upper bound for the number of surface-sheets. For that,
we need instead certain observations on the number of cut-points,
which then show that the number of sheets certainly cannot be greater
than 12.</p>
<p><a href="#49" name="49">&#182;</a> The second method, entirely different
from the first, in turn cannot be applied or transformed to decide
whether a surface of the fourth order with twelve sheets actually
exists.</p>
<p><a href="#50" name="50">&#182;</a> Since a quaternary form of the fourth
order possesses 35 homogeneous coefficients, we can conceive of a
given surface of the fourth order as a point in 34-dimensional space.
The discriminant of the quaternary form of fourth order is of degree
108 in its coefficients; if it is set equal to zero, it accordingly
represents in 34-dimensional space a surface of order 108. Since the
coefficients of the discriminant are themselves determinate integers,
the topological character of the discriminant surface can be precisely
determined by the rules that are familiar to us from 2- and
3-dimensional space; so we can obtain precise information about the
nature and significance of the individual subdomains into which the
discriminant surface partitions the 34-dimensional space. Now, the
surfaces of fourth order represented by points of these subdomains all
certainly possess the same sheet-number; and it is accordingly
possible to establish, by a long and wearying but finite calculation,
whether we have a surface of fourth order with n &#8804; 12 sheets or not.</p>
<p><a href="#51" name="51">&#182;</a> The geometric method just described is
thus a third way of treating our question about the maximum number of
sheets of a surface of the fourth order. It proves the decidability of
this question in a finite number of opera-tions. So in principle an
important demand of our problem has been satisfied: it has been
reduced to a problem of the level of difficulty of determining the \(
10^{(10^{10})} \)th numeral in the decimal expansion for &#120587;&#8212;a task
which is clearly solvable, but which remains unsolved.</p>
<p><a href="#52" name="52">&#182;</a> Rather, it took a profound and difficult
algebraic-geometric investigation by Rohn to show that 11 sheets are
not possible in a surface of the fourth order, while 10 sheets
actually occur. Only this fourth method delivered the full solution of
the problem.</p>
<p><a href="#53" name="53">&#182;</a> These particular discussions show how a
variety of methods of proof can be applied to the same problem, and
they ought to suggest how necessary it is to study the essence of
mathematical proof itself if one wishes to answer such questions as
the one about decidability in a finite number of operations.</p>
<p><a href="#54" name="54">&#182;</a> All such questions of principle, which I
characterized above and of which the question just discussed&#8212;that is,
the question about decidability in a finite number of operations&#8212;was
only the last, seem to me to form an important new field of research
which remains to be developed. To conquer this field we must, I am
persuaded, make the concept of specifically mathematical proof itself
into an object of investigation, just as the astronomer considers the
movement of his position, the physicist studies the theory of his
apparatus, and the philosopher criticizes reason itself.</p>
<p><a href="#55" name="55">&#182;</a> To be sure, the execution of this
programme is at present still an unsolved task.</p>
<p><a href="#56" name="56">&#182;</a> In conclusion, I should like to sum up
in a few sentences my general conception of the essence of the
axiomatic method. I believe: anything at all that can be the object of
scientific thought becomes dependent on the axiomatic method, and
thereby indirectly on mathematics, as soon as it is ripe for the
for-mation of a theory. By pushing ahead to ever deeper layers of
axioms in the sense explained above we also win ever-deeper insights
into the essence of scien-tific thought itself, and we become ever
more conscious of the unity of our knowledge. In the sign of the
axiomatic method, mathematics is summoned to a leading role in
science.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="#from" name="from">From</a> Ewald's introduction to the
above, in <em>From Kant to Hilbert</em>, volume 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hilbert is persistently misconstrued as a 'formalist', i.e. as
somebody who was so shaken by the paradoxes that he took up the
theory that mathematics is merely a game played with meaningless
symbols. But the intellectual background to Hilbert's proof theory
was richer than this. To be sure, the paradoxes were an important
goad; but he had more positive ambitions than the mere avoidance of
paradox. (Hilbert, in fact, in his unpublished G&#246;ttingen lectures,
repeatedly indicated that in his opinion Zermelo's work had
successfully resolved the known paradoxes.) His study of the
axiomatic foundations of geometry had yielded a rich harvest of
mathematical results&#8212;non-Archimedean geometries, a new topological
characterization of the plane, new theorems on the nature of
continuity&#8212;and there was every reason to hope that the same powerful
tool would prove equally useful in the other branches of mathematics
and physics mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>"As for the term 'formalist', it is so misleading that it should be
abandoned altogether as a label for Hilbert's philosophy of
mathematics. On the face of it, 'formalism' is not a felicitous
description for the style of reasoning one finds in <em>Anschauliche
Geometrie&#8211;'Intuitive geometry' (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen 1932)</em>, a
work which was written at the high-point of Hilbert's work in proof
theory; nor does it accurately convey the convictions of the man
who, in his G&#246;ttingen lectures, derided those who saw mathematics as
a mere heaping-up of consequences mechanically derived from a given
stock of axioms; nor the man who ended his essay, 'On the infinite',
by saying, 'We gain a conviction that runs counter to the earlier
endeavours of Frege and Dedekind, the conviction that, if scientific
knowledge is to be possible, certain intuitive conceptions
[Vorstellungen] and insights are indispensable; logic alone does not
suffice' (<em>Hilbert 1926</em>). As the present selection makes clear,
Hilbert viewed formal axiom systems instrumentally, as a powerful
tool for mathematical research, a tool to be employed when a field
had reached a point of sufficient ripeness. But he nowhere suggests
that the whole of mathematics can simply be <em>identified</em> with the
study of formal systems; and indeed in his proof-theoretical
writings he took considerable pains to point out that the genuine
mathematics&#8211;<em>inhaltliche Mathematik</em>&#8211;takes place, not in the
formalism, but in the meta-language. For all these reasons, Hilbert
himself rejected the label 'formalist' (see, for example, <em>Hilbert
1931a</em>, &#167;35), and students of his thought would do well to follow
his example."</p>

<title>The Book of Why, by Pearl and Mackenzie</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>In <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/">The Book of Why</a>, Judea Pearl explains that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_Pearl">Judea Pearl</a>'s
work is very important and most statisticians are malicious, fools, or
both. The attempt to popularize his work fails to usefully communicate
his contributions. You're better off reading his <a href="https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r481.pdf">Seven Tools</a>
paper, which in six pages is more complete than and as instructive as
the book.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="useful"></a>Possibly useful ideas</h3>
<p>The book is about how to answer questions based on data, which is a
topic I'm very interested in. I tried to <a href="/20200912-what_should_be_in_your_regression/">summarize</a> some of the
simplest ideas conveyed, about what variables to control for when
estimating an effect. The book isn't a textbook, but I wish it had
better explained how to implement more sophisticated control
techniques.</p>
<p>Pearl references a <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/aglynn/files/glynnkashin-frontdoor.pdf">paper</a> whose authors used paired observational
and experimental data, finding that "front-door adjustment" with the
observational data gives a result like that from the experimental
data. That's compelling! How can I use that adjustment?</p>
<p>I also liked the material (starting pages 200 and 309) on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox">Simpson's Paradox</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, I think the book is trying to offer some useful ideas. I
wish it were more successful in conveying them.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="no_causality"></a>Sidestepping causality</h3>
<p>You might think this book is about determining whether something
causes something else, based on data. It is <a href="#hill_guidelines">not</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... causal questions can never be answered from data alone." (page
351)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite Pearl's finality, there is research on doing just this. It
goes by <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/task/causal-discovery">causal discovery</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_causal_analysis">exploratory causal analysis</a>. In
<a href="http://www.chalearn.org/challenges.html">experiments</a>, some machine learning <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/guyon_isabelle_causality_challenge_final_short_r02.pdf">methods</a> do much better than
chance in identifying known causal relationships. Pearl even advised a
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2312">related paper</a>. I agree there are epistemological uncertainties in
this field, but it's interesting!</p>
<p>The closest the book comes to model identification are some allusions
to independence tests that can indicate data isn't consistent with a
model (or "Fit Indices" in <a href="https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r481.pdf">Seven Tools</a>). Pearl's causal models
come from the outside knowledge of humans.</p>
<p>The book also doesn't have much to say on the philosophy of causation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... I have not attempted to define causation anywhere in this book
..." (page 48)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That isn't quite true, because he does eventually discuss
counterfactual definitions of causality. But for the most part,
causation is given an axiomatic existence and becomes a silent arrow.
<a href="https://youtu.be/36GT2zI8lVA">Feynman</a> is more fun.</p>
<p>The arrows aren't necessarily bad, but the book is so
<a href="#impediments">busy</a> begging for unrelated praise that we don't get a
clear picture of what they're good for.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="no_ai"></a>Wishful AI</h3>
<p>Distinctions between statistics, machine learning, and AI can be
murky, but this book has a mostly statistical flavor. Given a causal
model and data, it's possible to estimate (learn) parameters and make
predictions.</p>
<p>As <a href="#no_causality">above</a>, there's no developed mechanism to learn
what the causal graph should be. Systems like
<a href="https://automaticstatistician.com/">The Automatic Statistician</a> do more to discover relationships in
data. Pearl's methods require a human to provide a causal graph.</p>
<p>I quite agree with Pearl that current AI seems too <a href="/20170429-from_behaviorist_to_constructivist_ai/">behaviorist</a>.
Mental models seem important to intelligence. His approach of defining
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence">symbolic</a> solution to a class of problems he likes is not a
compelling solution.</p>
<p>Like the proposal of Gary Marcus in The Algebraic Mind, Pearl
<a href="#brain">offers</a> that the symbolic system of his design "must be close
to the way that our brains represent" things (page 269). This is not
clear to me.</p>
<p>I agree that more advanced AI should be able to understand causality.
I'm not sure Pearl's explicit methods will play a part. I further
disagree with him on how <a href="#conversation">communication</a> works, and the
<a href="#chinese_room">Chinese Room</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="impediments"></a>Difficulties in reading</h3>
<p>I have to imagine that Pearl is likable in person, but his style here
reads as extreme self-praise and even putting down others to seem
better by comparison. Knowing him only through this book, it's hard to
root for him.</p>
<p>He tilts at straw men, writing as if <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/376920/the-book-of-why-by-judea-pearl-why-is-he-bashing-statistics">statisticians</a> and economists
have never thought about causality without his guidance. But
researchers have <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/141324NCJRS.pdf">not</a> been afraid to say things are "most likely a
cause, not just a correlate" even without his work.</p>
<p>To make his work seem more novel, he keeps it at a distance from
<a href="#coefficients">familiar</a> topics, even when only the interpretation is
different, preventing readers from easily connecting with prior
knowledge.</p>
<p>He writes as if he could have more quickly shown a connection between
smoking and lung cancer, but does not support this with evidence or
example of a feasible mechanism. You might disagree with Tufte about
whether data visualization could have prevented the Challenger
disaster, but at least Tufte <a href="https://blogs.stockton.edu/hist4690/files/2012/06/Edward-Tufte-Visual-and-Statistical-Thinking.pdf">shows</a> you the visualization.</p>
<p>In <a href="#interaction1">multiple</a> <a href="#interaction2">places</a>, Pearl says
linear models don't support interactions. There must be an
interpretation of this that is true, but I don't know what it is.
Interactions are commonly modeled with linear models.</p>
<p>I had hoped that with some effort I'd be able to follow the example on
page 83, but as far as I can tell it is incomplete or incorrect. (I
emailed the authors asking for clarification and will update as
appropriate.)</p>
<p>Andrew Gelman's <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/01/08/book-pearl-mackenzie/">notes</a> mention some issues with the book. (And some
others are even more <a href="#asylum">glaring</a>.) But also: Sherlock Holmes is
not known for deduction or induction, but for abduction (page 93).
It's not clear why we should change multiple variables on page 279,
but freeze them on page 312.</p>
<p>This book could have been so much better.</p>

<title>What should be in your regression?</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>If you're fitting a model in the hopes of better understanding the
effect of <em>x</em> on <em>y</em>, then including another predictor variable <em>z</em>
could be necessary, or could be harmful. Deciding whether to control
for <em>z</em> depends on identifying how the variables are causally related.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#direct">Simple direct causation</a></li>
<li><a href="#mediated">Mediated causation</a>: don't control for <em>z</em></li>
<li><a href="#common_cause">Common cause (confounding)</a>: control for <em>z</em></li>
<li><a href="#common_effect">Common effect (collider)</a>: don't control for <em>z</em></li>
<li><a href="#complicated">More complicated cases</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These examples vary the data generating process (which isn't possible
in practice) in order to illustrate what happens in each case when you
do or don't control for <em>z</em>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a> code uses random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal</a> data, additive relationships,
and linear regression. With real data and processes, other modeling
methods may be more appropriate.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="direct"></a>Simple direct causation</h3>
<p><img alt="x -&gt; y" src="direct.png"></p>
<p>Say the reality is that <em>x</em> influences <em>y</em> (not the reverse) and no
other variables are involved.</p>
<!-- set.seed(99) -->

<pre><code class="language-r">x = rnorm(100)
y = x + rnorm(100)
summary(lm(y ~ x))
##              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)
##  x            1.07747    0.11931   9.031 1.53e-14 ***</code></pre>

<p>The estimate of 1.077 is close to the true value of 1. The very low
p-value (with three stars) indicates confidence that there is a
non-random relationship between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="mediated"></a>Mediated causation</h3>
<p><img alt="x -&gt; z -&gt; y" src="mediated.png"></p>
<p>Here, the reality is that <em>x</em> influences <em>z</em>, which then influences
<em>y</em>.</p>
<p>In this case, <em>x</em> really does influence <em>y</em>, so you're right to look
for the relationship. And it might be tempting to control for <em>z</em>,
perhaps because of a desire to &#8220;isolate&#8221; the effect of <em>x</em>.</p>
<p>If you include <em>z</em> in your regression, the desired estimate of the
effect of <em>x</em> will disappear.</p>
<!-- set.seed(101) -->

<pre><code class="language-r">x = rnorm(100)
z = x + rnorm(100)
y = z + rnorm(100)
summary(lm(y ~ x + z))
##               Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)
##  x           -0.146874   0.135695  -1.082    0.282
##  z            1.127586   0.087819  12.840   &lt;2e-16 ***</code></pre>

<p>Including <em>z</em> makes it appear that <em>x</em> has no significant influence on
<em>y</em>, which is incorrect.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">summary(lm(y ~ x))
##              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)
##  x            1.11140    0.15343   7.244    1e-10 ***</code></pre>

<p>Leaving <em>z</em> out gives a good estimate of the effect of <em>x</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="common_cause"></a>Common cause (confounding)</h3>
<p><img alt="x &lt;- z -&gt; y" src="common_cause.png"></p>
<p>In this case, the reality is that <em>z</em> influences both <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>,
which are otherwise unrelated.</p>
<p>This is an extreme example, in the sense that you'd be totally wrong
to look for an effect of <em>x</em> on <em>y</em> in this case. The case where
there's also a direct connection between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> is similar, but
for simplicity this example doesn't have one.</p>
<p>If you don't include <em>z</em> in your regression, the relationship between
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> could be misleading.</p>
<!-- set.seed(103) -->

<pre><code class="language-r">z = rnorm(100)
x = z + rnorm(100)
y = z + rnorm(100)
summary(lm(y ~ x))
##              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)
##  x            0.56257    0.10365   5.428 4.14e-07 ***</code></pre>

<p>There is a relationship between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, but it's because of <em>z</em>,
not because of <em>x</em>. The regression result ignoring <em>z</em> could easily be
misinterpreted.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">summary(lm(y ~ x + z))
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)
## x            0.03608    0.10590   0.341    0.734
## z            1.05814    0.13556   7.806 6.93e-12 ***</code></pre>

<p>With <em>z</em> in the model, the result correctly indicates that <em>z</em> is the
influencing factor.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="common_effect"></a>Common effect (collider)</h3>
<p><img alt="x -&gt; z &lt;- y" src="collider.png"></p>
<p>Here, the reality is that <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are completely unrelated, but
they both influence <em>z</em>.</p>
<p>As with <a href="#common_cause">common cause</a>, it's more interesting when
there's also a direct connection between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, but the behavior
is similar and this example keeps things simpler.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, if you include <em>z</em> in your regression, you'll
see evidence that both <em>z</em> and <em>x</em> influence <em>y</em>.</p>
<!-- set.seed(105) -->

<pre><code class="language-r">x = rnorm(100)
y = rnorm(100)
z = x + y + rnorm(100)
summary(lm(y ~ x + z))
##              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)
##  x           -0.46951    0.08831  -5.317 6.76e-07 ***
##  z            0.44439    0.04971   8.939 2.62e-14 ***</code></pre>

<p>This is a case of &#8220;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3192123_Explaining_explaining_away%27">explaining away</a>.&#8221;</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">summary(lm(y ~ x))
##              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)
##  x           -0.11308    0.10586  -1.068    0.288</code></pre>

<p>Without <em>z</em> in the regression, the result correctly indicates no
relationship between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="complicated"></a>More complicated cases</h3>
<p>With a more complex causal graph, it may not be obvious what you need
to control for, or it may be that conventional methods of control
aren't sufficient. Methods like Judea Pearl's do-calculus might be
helpful.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks to Erica Blom, Ben Klemens, and Jonathan Robinson for providing
helpful feedback.</p>

<title>GPU environment variables</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><code>CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER</code> can default to <code>FASTEST_FIRST</code>, which may not
match the order you see in <code>nvidia-smi</code> output. Use
<code>CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID</code>.</p>
<p>Set <code>CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2</code> to only run on GPU 2. That GPU will then
be accessed as GPU 0, not GPU 2.</p>
<p>When using TensorFlow, you <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/gpu#limiting_gpu_memory_growth">can</a> set
<code>TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH=true</code> to keep TF from preemptively claiming
all the GPU memory. However, in my tests (with the older version 1.14)
TF still allocates way more memory than it really needs, so this
setting doesn't help much in practice.</p>

<title>A Mathematician's Lament, by Lockhart</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">Lockhart&#8217;s Lament</a> (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Lament">Exultation</a>!) is <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Mathematicians-Lament-School-Fascinating-Imaginative/dp/1934137170/">available</a> as a
beautiful little book. It&#8217;s in the familiar territory of balancing
doing original things versus learning what others have done, but he&#8217;s
probably right that many people don&#8217;t really know what <em>doing</em> math
is. I particularly identify with his emphasis on understanding and
good explanations.</p>
<p>Lockhart&#8217;s recommendation to do math for the pleasure of it reminds me
of McCullough&#8217;s similar thought on history:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It should be taught for pleasure: The pleasure of history, like art
or music or literature, consists of an expansion of the experience
of being alive, which is what education is largely about."
(<a href="https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/knowing-history-and-knowing-who-we-are/">McCullough</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is important to remember: People don&#8217;t really do things they
don&#8217;t enjoy. Pleasure can be found in most things, but it can be more
or less difficult to find. Finding it is important.</p>
<p>Lockhart correctly identifies the epistemology of math, in my opinion.
He points out that most people don&#8217;t need or use the math that&#8217;s
currently taught in schools, so losing it wouldn't be a great loss.
Carpenters don&#8217;t use trigonometry. Have you ever used the quadratic
formula?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure Lockhart wrote to change anyone&#8217;s mind, and he doesn&#8217;t
include many approachable recommendations. On page 82 he says, "There
should be no standards, and no curriculum." He recommends <a href="https://www.usgo.org/news/2016/07/paul-lockhart-named-teacher-of-the-year/">games</a>,
which is something, at least. He also teaches at a K-12 school where
students interview for a chance to pay $50k <a href="https://saintannsny.org/divisions-and-offices/finance/parents/tuition-financial-aid/tuition/">tuition</a>. I like his
ideas, but is there an accessible implementation?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"By concentrating on <em>what</em>, and leaving out <em>why</em>, mathematics is
reduced to an empty shell. The art is not in the &#8220;truth&#8221; but in the
explanation, the argument. It is the argument itself that gives the
truth its context, and determines what is really being said and
meant. Mathematics is <em>the art of explanation</em>." (page 29)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mental acuity of any kind comes from solving problems yourself, not
from being told how to solve them." (pages 53-54)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Accepting the standard math curriculum as being synonymous with math itself]
is intimately connected to what I call the &#8220;ladder myth&#8221;&#8212;the idea
that mathematics can be arranged as a sequence of &#8220;subjects&#8221; each
being in some way more advanced, or &#8220;higher,&#8221; than the previous. The
effect is to make school mathematics into a race&#8212;some students are
&#8220;ahead&#8221; of others, and parents worry that their child is &#8220;falling
behind.&#8221;" (page 56)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"High school students must learn to use the secant function, &#8216;sec
<em>x</em>,&#8217; as an abbreviation for the reciprocal of the cosine function,
&#8216;1 / cos <em>x</em>,&#8217; a definition with as much intellectual weight as the
decision to use &#8216;&amp;&#8217; in place of &#8220;and.&#8221; That this particular
shorthand, a holdover from fifteenth-century nautical tables, is
still with us (whereas others, such as &#8220;versine,&#8221; have died out) is
mere historical accident, and is of utterly no value in an era when
rapid and precise shipboard computation is no longer an issue. Thus
we clutter our math classes with pointless nomenclature for its own
sake." (pages 58-59)</p>

of a student&#8217;s mathematical life." (pages 60-61)</p>

<title>Share a tmux session</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Multiple people can connect to the same <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> session, with all
participants able to control the session. Combined with a voice
connection (phone, etc.) this can be used for remote pair programming
in an editor like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, for example.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># originating:
tmux -S /tmp/party_socket new -s party_session
chgrp shared_group /tmp/party_socket
# joining:
tmux -S /tmp/party_socket attach -t party_session</code></pre>

<hr>
<p>All participants need to be logged in to the same machine, likely
using <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/">ssh</a>. If everyone's logged in as the same user, you're
already done: just make a session and have everyone join it. If people
have separate user accounts, you need to think about sockets.</p>
<p>tmux uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket">socket</a> for communication. Joining will require access
to that socket.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">tmux -S /tmp/party_socket new -s party_session</code></pre>

<p>That line names the socket and the session explicitly, which is
convenient. In an existing tmux session, you can find your current
socket with "<code>echo $TMUX</code>", and you can check your session name with
"<code>tmux display-message -p '#S'</code>".</p>
<p>Let's grant access at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_identifier">group</a> level, assuming everyone is in a
group called <code>shared_group</code>. You can check using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/groups-invocation.html#groups-invocation">groups</a> and use an
existing shared group (<code>user</code> is common) which is convenient but will
allow anyone in that group to join. Or you could create a new group
for the purpose and add only the intended participants.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">chgrp shared_group /tmp/party_socket</code></pre>

<p>Now the group has access to the socket, and can join the tmux session.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">tmux -S /tmp/party_socket attach -t party_session</code></pre>

<p>If people don't need to control the session, they can add "<code>-r</code>" to
that line to join read-only.</p>
<p>This is a simple way to check who's connected to the session:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ps -eo user:16,cmd | grep party_session</code></pre>

<p>That could be made fancier (as in <a href="https://github.com/zolrath/wemux">wemux</a>, for example) but should
generally do the job.</p>

<title>e: The Story of a Number (and more)</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Maor">Eli Maor</a> gives a great <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691168487/e-the-story-of-a-number">history</a> of <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)"><em>e</em></a>, full of
personalities and math concepts that I found very enjoyable. I was
reminded of the difference between historical development and modern
understanding, which led me to revisit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Mathematics_Comes_From">Where Mathematics Comes From</a>, which has in its part VI perhaps a
better presentation of the latter way of knowing about <em>e</em>.</p>
<p>The historical perspective reminds me that math didn't start as formal
as it is now. Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki">Bourbaki</a> leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Math">New Math</a>, modern
formalism may not be the best way to teach concepts. Being able to
prove something and understanding it are not the same thing. I'm not
sure I agree completely with the idea of what math is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Mathematics_Comes_From">WMCF</a>, but
I do agree that humans do better when they understand things as
something more than just a game of symbol manipulation. In a similar
spirit to the <a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto">tau movement</a>, I think mathematical notation, proof,
and especially education should focus on communicating <em>meaning</em>.</p>
<p>More broadly, I think there ought to be <a href="https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/">Feynman explanations</a> for
more topics.</p>

<h3><a name="is_e_so_natural"></a>Is <em>e</em> so "natural?"</h3>
<p>I think <em>e</em> is not always the best choice of base, despite being the
"natural" log base. The advantages of <em>e</em> are largely to do with
calculus, and may not help in a particular application.</p>
<p>In the math for radioactive decay, often <em>e</em> is used even though
things are mostly otherwise in terms of half-life. This <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/quantum-physics/in-in-nuclei/v/exponential-decay-formula-proof-can-skip-involves-calculus">introduces</a>
complexity that just isn't necessary. It would be more convenient to
use 1/2 as the base. (I wonder whether <em>e</em> is used just because that's
the button people have on their calculators.)</p>
<p>In finance, interest is usually based on some finite period, like 1/12
of a year in the case of my savings account and mortgage. I did find,
<a href="https://twitter.com/planarrowspace/status/1293999229363458051">with help</a>, <a href="https://www.myfreeholdbank.com/savings.aspx">one bank</a> that compounds continuously for some
products. But usually \( e^x \) will be an approximation, not what
is really going on, for finance.</p>
<p>When scaling data with a log, changing the base is the same as
multiplying the scaled data by some constant. Especially if you're
already going to normalize that data (with a z-score, for example) or
use scale invariant techniques on the transformed data, it doesn't
matter what log base you use.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">softmax</a>, we do care about the derivative, but not really about
whether it's <em>exactly</em> equal to the function's value. When training a
neural net, the constant factor is "neutralized" by the constant
factor we introduce in the learning rate. At inference, using a
different base is the same thing as changing the softmax temperature,
which people already do for various reasons.</p>
<p>The number \( e \) is very cool, no doubt, but that doesn't mean it
has to be used for every application.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="a_quick_trip"></a>A quick trip to \( e^{\pi i} -1 = 0\)</h3>
<p>What function is always equal to its own derivative?</p>
<p>\[ f(x) = f'(x) \tag{1} \]</p>
<p>The constant function \( f(x) = 0 \) has that property, but is dull,
so leave it out.</p>
<p>The function can't ever touch the x-axis: the closer it gets, the
slower it approaches.</p>
<!-- Then the function can't ever touch the x-axis, because of
something like Zeno's paradox." -->

<p>The function can't be moved up or down, because that would break
equality with its derivative. It can be moved left or right, and it
can be flipped over the x-axis, so to pick a unique function, set the
y-intercept to be 1.</p>
<p>\[ f(0) = 1 \tag{2} \]</p>
<p>Equations (1) and (2) are enough to write out the function as a
polynomial.</p>
<p>Equation (2) says the constant term is 1. Equation (1) says the
polynomial must include a term whose derivative is 1, so the linear
term is \( \int{1} = x \). By the same reasoning, the next term is
\( \int{x} = \frac{1}{2} x^2 \), and the next is \( \frac{1}{3}
\cdot \frac{1}{2} x^3 \), and so on. This gives equation (3).</p>
<p>\[ f(x) =
    1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \dots =
    \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}
    \tag{3} \]</p>
<p>The functions with derivatives proportional to their values are the
exponential functions, \( f(x) = b^x \). Equation (2) is aligned
with \( b^0 = 1 \). Using \( b^1 = b \) identifies the base for
equation (3).</p>
<p>\[ f(1) =
    \frac{1}{0!} + \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} + \dots =
    2.718281828
    \tag{4} \]</p>
<p>This is \( e \), and it's \( e \) not by numerical equality but
because this is the essence of \( e \): the base of the exponential
whose derivative equals its value.</p>
<p>\[ e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} \tag{5} \]</p>
<p>This relates exponentiation using arbitrary powers with using only
integer powers. It already supports complex exponents if you don't
mind doing some calculating.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import math

def approx_exp(x, terms=20):
    return sum(x**n / math.factorial(n) for n in range(terms))

approx_exp(math.pi * 1j)
## (-1.0000000035290801-5.289182672965142e-10j)</code></pre>

<p>\[ e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0 \tag{6} \]</p>
<p>To understand why that should be, consider that exponentiation
connects addition and multiplication, as \( b^{m + n} = b^m \cdot b^n
\). Imaginary numbers add as usual, but their multiplication amounts
to rotation. The base \( e \) has the property that rotation is
given in radians, so \( \pi i \) means one half turn, taking the
result to -1.</p>
<p>This can also be seen by discovering that \( e^{xi} = \cos{x} + i
\sin{x} \), for example by checking that their values at 0 and all
their derivatives are equal.</p>
<p>Negative bases have the funny property that their even exponents give
positive results, but odd exponents give negative results. What should
the result be for an exponent like 1.2, then? Thinking of rotation, it
makes sense that results sweep through complex values to get from the
positive real axis to the negative real axis and so on. This is a fine
way to draw a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_spiral">logarithmic spiral</a>. It can be connected to equation
(6).</p>
<p>\[ (-b)^x = b^x (-1)^x = b^x (e^{\pi i})^x = b^x e^{x \pi i} \tag{7} \]</p>
<p>The rotation comes from the negative base <em>already</em> being rotated to
begin with. In fact it's only the boring positive real numbers that
don't rotate when exponentiated.</p>
<hr>
<p>Forgive me for using \( \pi \) despite mentioning \( \tau \)
above; \( \pi \) is so familiar in this context that I didn't want
to introduce a separate new thing, even though \( \tau \) is
arguably better <em>especially</em> in this setting.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="a_few_quotes"></a>A few quotes from <em>e</em>: The Story of a Number</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Though [William] Oughtred held no official university position, his
contributions to mathematics were substantial. In his most
influential work, the <em>Clavis mathematicae</em> (1631), a book on
arithmetic and algebra, he introduced many new mathematical symbols,
some of which are still in use today. (Among them is the symbol &#215;
for multiplication, to which Leibniz later objected because of its
similarity to the letter <em>x</em>; two other symbols that can still be
seen occasionally are :: to denote a proportion and ~ for "the
difference between.")" (page 15)</p>
<p>"The Pythagoreans believed that numbers are the prime cause behind
everything in the world, from the laws of musical harmony to the
motion of the planets. "Number rules the universe" was their motto,
and by "number" they meant natural numbers and their ratios;
everything else&#8212;negative numbers, irrational numbers, and even
zero&#8212;was excluded." (page 51)</p>
<p>"[William Rowan] Hamilton's rigorous approach marked the beginning
of axiomatic algebra: ..." (page 167)</p>
