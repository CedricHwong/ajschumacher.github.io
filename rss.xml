<title>The Economics of Star Trek, by Webb</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I read the print version of the <a href="https://medium.com/@RickWebb/the-economics-of-star-trek-29bab88d50">blog post</a>, which delivers on the
fun of thinking about a world with the economics of the Star Trek
future. In the end you can't expect scifi to deliver economic
salvation, but imaginative inspiration is a fine starting point for
learning and thinking more.</p>
<p>I didn't really find Webb's guesses to constitute a workable system,
though I can't really say whether the problem is his, Star Trek's, or
the failure of my imagination.</p>
<p>There's also an even more serious book on this topic: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekonomics">Trekonomics</a>,
by Manu Saadia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If you don't believe that nothing is forever, if you don't believe
that society and humans can change, then you do not believe in the
future (and, incidentally, you do not believe in the past either)."
(page 11, in Manu Saadia's Foreward)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The one thing the show gets right is violence.</p>
<p>"I would point to a recent book by Stanford historian Walter
Scheidel: <em>The Great Leveler: Violence and The History of Inequality
from the Stone Age to the Twenty First Century</em> (Princeton
University Press, 2017). Professor Scheidel's thesis is that
throughout human history, only violence and war have truly managed
to solve economic conflicts&#8211;and even more so when economic
inequality got out of control, whether in pre-modern agrarian
societies or during the turbulent and genocidal last century.
Western Europe's prosperity rose out of the ashes and gas chambers
of World War II. The war annihilated the old social hierarchies on
the Continent, capitalists who happily collaborated with the Nazis
were cast out of society and expropriated, thus removing the main
opposition to expansive social safety net and to the modern welfare
state. Former enemies began to cooperate and to coordinate, first
economically and later politically. The European Union grew out of
the War, it was a project borne out of the resistance to Nazism. The
same is true of the post-war economic order (mostly, the
Bretton-Woods accords shepherded by John Maynard Keynes) and of the
United Nations. It is important to remember that all these were
noble yet practical projects, conceived and imagined by idealists
while the war was raging on and its outcome was still very much in
the balance. If anything this proves that there is value in
imagination and idealism, especially in times of great upheaval. One
must always be ready." (pages 12-13, in Manu Saadia's Foreward)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a strange mix of dark and light...</p>
<p>(In Star Trek, many advances happened following
<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Eugenics_Wars">The Eugenics Wars of the 1990s</a>.)</p>
<p>Webb also opines on page 141 that "the sense lingers that if we <em>are</em>
to arrive at a Trek vision of the future, we might have to go through
our own version of The Eugenics Wars to get there."</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Federation seems a bit like Williamsburg&#8211;a lot of artists who
don't need to work." (page 41)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Interesting bit on page 90 about a UBI study showing it increased
divorce rates (which people took as a bad thing, I think) but then
later it turned out the divorce result was a statistical error.</p>
<hr>
<p>John Kenneth Galbraith's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Affluent_Society">The Affluent Society</a> is referenced on
pages 134-135 as a text whose "arguments can be said to underpin [the]
Trek ideal."</p>
<p>Page 135 also references Fred Hirsch's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hirsch#Limits_to_Growth">Social Limits to Growth</a>.</p>

<title>Game Changer, by Solomon and Blumberg</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I picked this up because of the subtitle, "How to be 10x in the talent
economy." I'm interested in human <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/issues/174">differences in productivity</a>. The
<a href="https://www.harpercollinsleadership.com/game-changer/">book</a> had little to say on the technical side, but emphasized
balancing "hard" and "soft" skills, with a big focus on continual
improvement via feedback and coaching. The book is largely an
advertisement for the authors' businesses (10x <a href="https://www.10xmanagement.com/">management</a> /
<a href="https://10xascend.com/">ascend</a>) and I think fairly effective as such.</p>
<p>I've worked in a couple companies with variations on the theme of
having a "career manager" and a "project manager," sometimes the same
person, which can engender conflicts of interest. Solomon and
Blumberg's talent management model essentially outsources your career
management to an independent firm, which is interesting. It could be
viewed as a kind of <a href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/matrix-organization-structure-reason-evolution-1837">matrixing</a> that extends beyond company borders.</p>
<p>Another way of viewing it is as starting your own consultancy but
outsourcing lead generation (and some other functions, like contracts)
to Solomon and Blumberg. That removes a major difficulty of going it
alone, if it works well. There are still trade-offs associated with
working 1099 vs. W-2 jobs; better health insurance options etc. would
still help more people make the leap toward greater independence from
corporations.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>The authors give a quantitative example early on to make "10x" real:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Two weeks later, Nicole returned to our office with the news that
she had let go of no less than thirty-three of her thirty-six-person
team. <em>More than 90 percent.</em> She was sorry to lay off that many
fine workers and was quick to mention that they were well taken care
of, but there was no way around this one simple fact: Our three
recommended 10xers could deliver a better, stronger, more
sustainable product than thirty-three or even a hundred engineers
who were just "very good."" (page xiv)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's some interesting conversation to be had about labor relations,
the future of work, and what direction we really want to move in, I
think.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the new talent economy, everybody you deal with better be 10x,
or at least striving to be." (page xiv)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Great talent becomes 10x when it develops the quality of
<em>manageability</em>&#8211;the ability to seek out and internalize powerful
outside guidance, built on an insatiable desire for growth and
improvement." (page xx)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... they do it because <em>they love the doing of it</em>&#8211;it's the most
important thing you can know about 10xers." (page 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... the future will see work and learning blend into one." (page
14, quoting <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2019/01/02/solving-future-skills-challenges/">The Key To Solving Future Skills Challenges</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 16 they reference
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/24/the-two-pizza-rule-and-the-secret-of-amazons-success">The two-pizza rule and the secret of Amazon's success</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>They speak positively about Objectives and Key Results (<a href="https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/">OKRs</a>)...
Maybe I should try those?</p>
<hr>
<p>They have a neat <a href="https://10xascend.com/calculator/">Lifestyle Calculator</a> for considering 24 different
priorities in considering a job.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"When you see a door, what do you do? Do you break it down, kick it
open? Or do you go under it, over it? I need people who consider
every possibility, who can't just look at a thing for what it
usually is. They find strategic solutions from every angle. If you
can't do that, then you're the kind of person that gets stuck, and I
don't have time to help you when you do." (page 34, quoting Jesse
Lee)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Addiction, self-sabotage, procrastination, laziness, rage, chronic
fatigue, and depression are all ways that we withhold our full
participation in the program of life that we are offered." (page 43,
quoting Charles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Eisenstein#The_More_Beautiful_World_Our_Hearts_Know_is_Possible">Eisenstein</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Chapter 3, "Success and Sabotage&#8211;The Manageability Continuum," is
largely about growth via feedback, and hiring for people who can do
that.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The cost of a bad hire is incalculable, and not just from a
financial perspective." (page 57)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""I don't think you can fix a temper. For the bottom 10 percent,
sabotage is just so ingrained in their personality. And I'm not a
big fan of performance improvement plans. Ninety-five percent of the
time, they're not going to make it, and if they do make it, you're
just excusing the fact that they're not really the right person for
the job because you don't want HR to be upset. It's very unusual for
someone from that lower 10 percent or 15 percent to suddenly become
a top 10 percent. At best you can move them into the middle group
where they can contribute without getting in the way."</p>
<p>"Goldsmith is far more optimistic about the 80 percent in the
middle, those with mixed impulses. "<em>They</em> can change. I've seen
examples when great leaders have been put in place that inspire
previously unsuccessful teams and individuals."" (pages 58-59,
quoting Scott Goldsmith)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""The biggest change was...the leader worked hard to help the
individuals on that team to <em>change their mindset.</em>"" (page 59,
quoting Scott Goldsmith)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""I ask potential new hires one question: <em>'On a scale of one to
ten, how weird are you?'</em> And I never hire lower than a seven.""
(page 59, quoting Scott Goldsmith)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On pages 62-63, they highlight three interview questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How well did the potential 10xer handle a significant mistake of
   their own making?</li>
<li>How does the potential 10xer handle a situation where a boss or
   client wants something he or she thinks is a bad idea?</li>
<li>What does the potential 10xer identify as their biggest
   professional weaknesses?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>On page 70 they talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window">Johari window</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""In fact, I believe that in the future we're going to look back and
say that what we did before genetic engineering was barbaric and
like playing a genetic lottery on our children."" (page 125, quoting
Bryan Bishop)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book doesn't say much of anything about genetic contributions to
being "10x" and this quote isn't intended to be related to that topic,
but the concept is sort of uncomfortably in the background somehow...</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... once you lose the talent war, you completely limit a company's
ability to compete and excel." (page 140)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"After all, the difference between management and leadership is
huge." (page 142)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am humbly and strongly requesting your feedback. We have a lot of
contact on an ongoing basis and I am really focused on learning more
about my weaknesses, blind spots, or other areas that need
meaningful improvement." (page 164)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Part of some recommended language for soliciting feedback.)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no
one else can see."" (page 187, quoting Arthur Schopenhauer)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 200, they talk about what they call a "L.E.A.P. doc" which is
an employment List of Expectations and Priorities, which they suggest
sending as a kind of first move in negotiating employment. An
interesting idea.</p>

<title>How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, by Bennett</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I've recommended this 1908 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Live_on_24_Hours_a_Day">book</a> since <a href="/2010/07/31/thoughts-on-tinkering-toward-utopia/">2010</a>/<a href="/20160320-books_for_professionals/">2011</a>, and I
thought I'd revisit it. The sexist language makes it hard to continue
recommending; I'd love to see a modern version.</p>
<p>The main message I take from this reading is the need to slow down,
when trying to do more. Reflect. Think. It's not packing as much as
possible into the time you have, it's getting as much as you can out.
As with eating, the good life isn't just quantity per time.</p>
<p>I relate aspects of this book to more recent <a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/">ideas</a> about
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">learning</a> and memory, which I also think are good. Many of the
charming aspects of the book relate to the <em>why</em> more than the <em>how</em>
of learning, and try to encourage the reader to believe that they
<em>can</em> find the time to do more. (A modern version might reference
statistics on <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/people-are-spending-most-of-their-waking-hours-staring-at-screens-2018-08-01">screen-watching</a>, and find that people have a lot of
time that might be better spent.)</p>
<p>Taken mildly, Bennett's advice is to get a hobby, to develop an
interest, aligned with "cultivation of the mind." Taken more
seriously, he encourages more purposeful, joyful, and "examined" life.
I can get behind both sentiments.</p>

<title>The Variance Sum Law is Interesting</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The <a href="http://onlinestatbook.com/2/glossary/variance_sum_law.html">Variance Sum Law</a> is simple enough that it's often given
without explanation, but I think it's interesting enough that it
deserves a little thought.</p>
<p>The Variance Sum Law says that for two independent random variables
\( A \) and \( B \) with variances \( \sigma_A^2 \) and \(
\sigma_B^2 \), the sum \( A+B \) has variance \( \sigma_{A+B}^2 =
\sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2 \).</p>
<p>Explaining an application of this, you might consider an example: say
\( a = 10 \) and \( b = 3 \).</p>
<p>This kind of example is used in at least one course to introduce
<a href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/2/2.5">analysis of variance</a>. After introducing the \( 13 = 10 + 3 \)
part, they continue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Although the derivation isn't as simple as it seems, the
decomposition holds for the sum of the squared distances, too."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's possible to find a <a href="http://web.pdx.edu/~joel8/resources/ConceptualPresentationResources/VarianceSumLaw.pdf">derivation</a>, but they're generally not very
satisfying. And you know that the sum of squares is not the same as
the square of the sum: \( 13^2 \neq 10^2 + 3^2 \) because \( 169
\neq 109\). So what's going on?</p>
<p>Using a single example helps explain what one element of data looks
like, but a single example doesn't have a variance.</p>
<p>We can make the example just slightly more complete to show how
variances add.</p>
<p>Say \( A \) is \( +10 \) half the time and \( -10 \) half the
time, while \( B \) is equally likely to be \( +3 \) or \( -3
\). So \( \sigma_A^2 = 100 \) and \( \sigma_B^2 = 9 \).</p>
<p>All our squares will be positive, so we can ignore negative outcomes
by symmetry here.</p>
<p>With that simplification, notice \( A + B \) is equally likely to be
\( 10 - 3 = 7 \) or \( 10 + 3 = 13 \).</p>
<p>\[ \frac{(10-3)^2 + (10-3)^2}{2} = \frac{7^2 + 13^2}{2} = \frac{49 + 169}{2} = \frac{218}{2} = 109 = 100 + 9 = 10^2 + 3^2 \]</p>
<p>The addition and subtraction cancel out after squaring so that the
variances add.</p>
<p>This property, that \( (a+b)^2 + (a-b)^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2)\), is what
makes variance decomposition work, for uncorrelated components.</p>
<p>It's simple algebra, but it's still kind of neat. Here's a geometric
illustration:</p>
<p><img alt="geometric illustration" src="geometric_illustration.jpg"></p>
<p>\[ (a-b)^2 + (a+b)^2 = b^2 + a^2 + a^2 + b^2 \]</p>
<p>Maybe this is completely intuitive for some people, but for me this
balancing of increased and decreased squares is something of a
pleasant surprise. Stop and smell the mathematical roses, you know?</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/420387/122282">also</a> a Pythagorean connection, which I think is neat, but
I haven't so far gotten it lined up with my intuition.</p>

<title>Failure to Disrupt, by Reich</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>As is especially salient during a pandemic, "technology alone can't
transform education." Reich's <a href="https://failuretodisrupt.com/">book</a> nicely wraps up the most recent
edtech hype cycle, which I was more optimistic about <a href="/2011/09/10/future-of-education/">at the time</a>. Reich thinks we have to keep <a href="/2010/07/31/thoughts-on-tinkering-toward-utopia/">tinkering toward utopia</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kinds of edtech "learning at scale"<ul>
<li><a href="#chapter1">MOOCs</a> (instructor-guided)</li>
<li><a href="#chapter2">adaptive tutors</a> (algorithm-guided)</li>
<li><a href="#chapter3">open world</a> (self/peer-guided)</li>
<li><a href="#chapter4">games</a> (aspects mostly of adaptive and open)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Challenges<ul>
<li><a href="#chapter5">difficult to get adoption</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter6">mostly helps those who least need help</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter7">complex tasks defy simple assessments</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter8">data/experiments risks/benefits</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I mostly agree with Reich, except that now I tend to put more weight
on knowledge &#224; la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._D._Hirsch">Hirsch</a>, and I still have hope for the
application of tools like <a href="/20201009-anki_is_easy/">Anki</a> in educational settings.</p>

<h3><a name="chapter1"></a>Chapter 1: Instructor-Guided Learning at Scale: Massive Open Online Courses</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"To a first approximation, there are only two primary approaches to
teaching and learning. As Plutarch wrote in "On Listening" in the
first century CE, "Education is not the filling of a pail, but the
lighting of a fire."" (page 22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reich then identifies "instructionism" and "social constructivism" as
names for these approaches, associated with Edward L. Thorndike and
John Dewey, respectively.</p>
<p>One thing I thought I noticed in edtech over the years was a trend in
which companies that focused on algorithms (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knewton">Knewton</a>) moved
toward being more like content companies over time. In a sense they
started as pail companies, but found people wouldn't buy empty pails.
Might be related to the <a href="#chapter5">adoption problem</a>.</p>
<p>This is a fun metaphor to play with. I think it might be better as
"not the stacking of wood, but the lighting of a fire." When a fire is
burning, you want to keep getting more wood. The wood is largely the
same in both approaches; the difference is the motivation or
application around it.</p>

purposes of higher education, ..." (page 27)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"People develop self-regulated learning strategies through direct
instruction and practice, often through a long apprenticeship in
formal educational systems." (page 36)</p>

straight line." (page 60)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't seem true. Maybe it means that with a log y axis, the
left and right sides are each approximately linear? I <a href="https://twitter.com/planarrowspace/status/1311371349957505030">tweeted</a> at
Reich about this.</p>

<p>"Reading instructors sometimes discuss a transition, which happens
in about the third grade, from learning to read&#8211;learning how to
decode the sounds and meaning of text&#8211;to reading to learn&#8211;using
reading to advance content knowledge." (pages 63-64)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ritter's research team looked at how much adaptive mastery learning
teachers actually allowed in their classes, and they found that some
teachers assigned work in Carnegie Learning in such a way that it
wasn't really personalized&#8211;these teachers required students to work
on problem sets related to the topics being taught at that moment to
the whole class. By contrast, other teachers allowed students to
work at their own pace, even if this meant that some students were
still doing practice problems on topics that might have been covered
in class weeks earlier. Ritter's team found that overall learning
gains were higher in the classes where students were allowed more
opportunities to move at their own pace; in other words, the
teachers who used Carnegie Learning as intended had more learning
gains in their classrooms than did the teachers who kept their
students moving in lockstep." (page 70)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Makes me think about whole-group single track, tracking, personalized
via computer, tutoring, and how these are thought about in different
ways...</p>

<h3><a name="chapter3"></a>Chapter 3: Peer-Guided Learning at Scale: Networked Learning Communities</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The consensus about the great potential of personalized learning
depended on a stark disagreement about what the term actually
meant." (page 77)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roughly, this is referring to personalizing <em>pace</em> (go through the
same material but at whatever speed you like) versus personalizing
<em>content</em> (choose your own area of interest, pursue it however you
want).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... a shift in identity where the learning activity is a part of
who they are rather than something that they do ..." (page 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 95, a reference to
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1">Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching</a>:</p>

<p>"The advantage of guidance begins to recede only when learners have
sufficiently high prior knowledge to provide &#8220;internal&#8221; guidance."

</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Put simply, people have a limited working memory, and when learners
allocate that working memory to solving a problem, they often are
not permanently encoding learning about the patterns and practices
that let them solve that type of problem." (page 95)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Reich raises the issue of people choosing to get involved in bad stuff
like hate groups. So total freedom in what to get into isn't
necessarily great.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Somehow, millions of people around the world find ways to teach and
learn with one another online without any formal training and
sometimes without any organization, and yet when designers try to
create these kinds of environments with intention, they encounter
substantial challenges with motivation and comprehension." (page
102)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is he deliberately avoiding the obvious interpretation from
selection/observation bias? In a whole world, some people have
motivation and comprehension to do great things. If you have a fixed
group of students that isn't skimming those people, many won't. It
seems highly likely that peer-guided learning at scale has the same
issue as other MOOCs, in that the people who benefit are
overwhelmingly people who are already doing really well to begin with.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thinking about the various ways to do whole class together vs. totally
personalized/independent learning... When I was teaching,
"differentiation" was the popular term for customizing class
activities for students who were struggling or way ahead...</p>
<p>I think really, there's some stuff that we want all students to learn,
and there are learning experiences that make sense to do with a whole
class: stuff about working in groups, communication, etc. It would be
neat to have more explicit separation between a small whole-group set
of content, and scaffolding for students to study more things on their
own.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter4"></a>Chapter 4: Testing the Genres of Learning at Scale: Learning Games</h3>
<hr>
<p>The difficulty of <em>transfer</em> (mentioned page 109) makes me wonder to
what extent transfer is related to general intelligence - or whether
they might even be largely the same thing.</p>
<p>The referenced <em>Critical Thinking: Why Is It So Hard to Teach?</em>
(<a href="https://www.readingrockets.org/article/critical-thinking-why-it-so-hard-teach">web</a>, <a href="https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/Crit_Thinking.pdf">more complete PDF</a>) is quite good.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"A more pessimistic view built upon the research on transfer is that
people who spend a lot of time playing <em>Minecraft</em> will primarily
learn about playing <em>Minecraft</em>." (page 119)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But: some reasonable notes on, for example, the general strategy of
knowing to look things up online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Domain-independent skills are slightly useful in lots of different
domains but not deeply useful in any particular domain." (page 120)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"an <em>edtech Matthew effect</em> is quite common: that new technologies
disproportionately benefit learners with the financial, social, and
technical capital to take advantage of new innovations." (page 125)</p>

<hr>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Prw3xbk1Wo&amp;ab_channel=HippoCrit">Zoombinis</a> game seems kind of neat? Maybe mathier puzzles than
other puzzle games? Or not? Shrug?</p>

<h3><a name="chapter5"></a>Chapter 5: The Curse of the Familiar</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The dilemma that Resnick and colleagues face as Scratch is widely
adopted in schools is that a variety of typical school structures
are inimical to the pedagogical philosophy behind Scratch." (page
134)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Reich is neglecting something that Scratch has in common with
most edtech, and which he comments on for other types: Learning with
Scratch depends hugely on the student being prepared for and/or having
characteristics that align with learning with Scratch.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>

physical coding cards ..." (page 138)</p>

<h3><a name="chapter6"></a>Chapter 6: The Edtech Matthew Effect</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom argues that technologists often
imagine their students as "roaming autodidacts," which she describes
as "a self-motivated, able learner that is simultaneously embedded
in technocratic futures <em>and</em> disembedded from place, culture,
history, and markets."" (page 159)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter7"></a>Chapter 7: The Trap of Routine Assessment</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Autograders excel at assessing routine tasks. These are exactly the
kinds of tasks that we no longer need humans to do." (page 171)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incomplete. There are lots of basic things that humans need to
be able to do that can be assessed automatically. But I agree that
higher-level skills are difficult to assess automatically.</p>
<hr>
<p>Reich makes an example of a plumber who installs a water heater with
an LED panel and then says on page 175: "What would it be like to
explain to the young men in that apprenticeship program that fifty
years later, plumbers would be computer programmers?" This isn't the
case. The plumber who in fact installed his water heater didn't do any
programming. This was a bad example for the point I think Reich hoped
to make.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... the "reification fallacy," when we uncritically believe that
something's name accurately represents what that thing actually is."
(page 176)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somewhat unusual way of explaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)">this</a>. Interesting.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Computers can mostly assess what computers are good at doing, and
these are things we do not need humans to do in the labor market."
(page 197)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I already commented on this, but I'll comment again: I think he's
ignoring the many things that humans should be able to do that
computers can also do. I'm thinking mostly of simple recall, where
knowing something by heart (immediately) is way better than being able
to look it up (if you even know that it exists, to look up).</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter8"></a>Chapter 8: The Toxic Power of Data and Experiments</h3>
<hr>
<p>Mostly, I think Reich is pulling punches in this chapter. He doesn't
go where I thought he was going to: He doesn't really address possible
abuses of student data or the negative effects that can arise
(intentionally or accidentally) from data and experiment.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If online learning leads to better outcomes from students, it will
be through the amalgamation of a thousand or ten thousand studies
like this one that incrementally accrete a knowledge base about
effective online learning." (page 223)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Reich takes his "tinkering" a little too far sometimes. If
what's really needed is a bigger leap, ten thousand incremental
experiments won't necessarily get there.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion: Preparing for the Next Learning-at-Scale Hype Cycle</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In 1913, Thomas Edision declared that the age of books was about to
give way to the age of motion pictures. He told an interviewer,
"Books will soon be obsolete in the public schools. Scholars will be
instructed through the eye. It is possible to teach every branch of
human knowledge with the motion picture. Our school system will be
completely changed inside of ten years." When Edison's ten-year
prediction failed to come to pass, he simple gave himself more time.
In 1923, speaking before the Federal Trade Commission, Edison
explained, "I made an experiment with a lot of [motion] pictures to
teach children chemistry. I got twelve children and asked them to
write down what they had learned, from the [motion] pictures. I was
amazed that such a complicated subject as chemistry was readily
grasped by them to a large extent through [motion] pictures. The
parts of the [motion] pictures they did not understand I did over
and over again until they finally understood the entire [motion]
picture. I think motion pictures have just started and it is my
opinion that in 20 years children will be taught through [motion]
pictures and not through textbooks."" (pages 229-230)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was worth reading the book just for these quotes, for this
video-hater.</p>
<p>Quote Investigator has the <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/02/15/books-obsolete/">receipts</a>, as usual. And you can read

people develop self-regulated learning through an apprenticeship in

<title>Sampling can be hard to beat, for text understanding</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>If you have a lot of related documents (like thousands of reviews of a
product, or answers to a survey question) you might be tempted to use
an automatic procedure to summarize them (maybe making a word cloud,
or applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation">LDA</a>, or something fancier). No automated process is
flawless, but if you need to work with many groups of documents, such
an approach could be called for. Regardless of whether you use an
automated technique, you should still start by reading a sample of
documents, and in fact reading may be the best way to understand what
people have said.</p>
<p>This is a special case of a few more general principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the data</li>
<li>Simple techniques can be very effective</li>
<li>Start with a baseline for comparison</li>
</ul>

<title>The Point of Pointless Work, by Almossawi</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The title's not quite right, but there's some on that. <a href="https://almossawi.com/pointless-work/">It</a>'s mostly
Almossawi's personal adventures in publishing: the stories of
<a href="/20201012-bad_arguments_by_almossawi/">Bad Arguments</a> and <a href="/20201011-bad_choices_by_almossawi/">Bad Choices</a>. I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I liked the detail about publishing, including buying a pack of ten
ISBNs, and agonizing about getting pallets of books from a ship and
into Amazon fulfillment centers.</p>
<p>I also think he's right that it's good for people to do things not
just out of economic necessity, and we're fortunate when we're able to
do so.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Selected quotes and commentary</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Anatol Rapoport has excellent advice about how to criticize. A
critic, he says, ought to begin by stating the other side's position
in a fair and objective way, then mentioning the areas of agreement,
and only then mentioning the areas of disagreement. The approach
does wonders when the goal is to turn something into a better
version of itself rather than to posture." (page 42)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also found more on this in a <a href="http://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/06/16/rapoport-rules-criticism/">post</a> based on a book by Dennett
which is in my to-read pile.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was surprised to find that the copyeditors were all freelancers.
... When [prior employee copyeditors] retired, the publisher
determined that it made economic and organizational sense to
outsource that responsibility to freelancers." (page 74)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet another example of trying to get work done by contractors rather
than employees.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... Abraham Flexner's essay from almost a century ago on useless
knowledge." (page 100)</p>

<title>Problem Solving 101, by Watanabe</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/304164/problem-solving-101-by-ken-watanabe/">book</a> by a former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_%26_Company">McKinsey</a> consultant "started as a simple
guide to teach Japanese schoolchildren critical thinking skills." It's
a different perspective than the more math-focused
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It">How to Solve It</a>, for example, focusing on problems of everyday
life.</p>
<h3>Watanabe's steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>"understand the current situation"</li>
<li>"identify the root cause of the problem"</li>
<li>"develop an effective action plan"</li>
<li>"execute until the problem is solved, making modifications as necessary"</li>
</ol>
<h3>P&#243;lya's steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, you have to understand the problem.</li>
<li>After understanding, make a plan.</li>
<li>Carry out the plan.</li>
<li>Look back on your work. How could it be better?</li>
</ol>
<p>From these we learn that five steps is too many steps.</p>
<p>Watanabe emphasizes a number of visual aids:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Logic tree" - break something down into sub-groups, exhaustively</li>
<li>"Yes/no tree" - a logic tree with yes/no logic, drawn as a
   flowchart</li>
<li>"Problem-solving design plan" - columns for Issue, Hypothesis,
   Rationale, Analysis/Activities, Information Source (mostly about
   understanding the problem)</li>
<li>"Hypothesis pyramid" - Boxes with arrows to show (possible)
   contributing factors for a conclusion, both for plausible reasoning
   and for deductive reasoning as appropriate</li>
<li>"Pros and cons; Criteria and evaluation" - Tables with various
   structure for pros and cons</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple times he also uses quadrant charts where the axes are impact
and effort (for prioritizing). An interesting variation is that he has
his characters think about how to <em>change</em> the required effort by
asking friends for help, etc.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Selected quotes and (very rarely) comments</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Being a problem solver isn't just an ability; it's a whole
mind-set, one that drives people to bring out the best in themselves
and to shape the world in a positive way." (page ix)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... approaches to broaden and organize one's thinking ..." (page x)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"Problem solving isn't a talent limited to the lucky few. It's
actually a skill and a habit that you can learn." (page 4)</p>

<p>"People often fall into the trap of collecting information and
conducting analyses just for the sake of doing them." (page 38)</p>

<title>Bad Arguments, by Almossawi</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I wondered if there was a book of fallacies, and it turned out there
were several. Almossawi's is the cutest by far, and it's
<a href="https://bookofbadarguments.com/">freely available</a> online.</p>
<p>Thinking about fallacies is a fun way to think about how we reason,
and how we conceptualize things. There's no one correct taxonomy of
fallacies, and fallacies aren't always bad arguments. Books like this
are good for starting to access some of these ideas.</p>
<hr>
<p>Almossawi has one of his distinctive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind map</a>s at the beginning of
the book. Linearized, the topics in the book look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical fallacies<ul>
<li>Formal<ul>
<li>Propositional<ul>
<li><strong>Affirming the consequent</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Informal<ul>
<li>Ambiguity<ul>
<li><strong>Equivocation</strong><ul>
<li>Redefinition<ul>
<li><strong>No true Scotsman</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Causal<ul>
<li><strong>Not a cause for a cause</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Slippery slope</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unwarranted assumption<ul>
<li><strong>False dilemma</strong></li>
<li><strong>Composition and division</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Begging the question<ul>
<li><strong>Circular reasoning</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weak analogy<ul>
<li>Unrepresentative sample<ul>
<li><strong>Hasty generalization</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Missing data<ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to ignorance</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Red herrings<ul>
<li><strong>Argument from consequences</strong></li>
<li><strong>Guilt by association</strong></li>
<li><strong>Straw man</strong></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to the bandwagon</strong></li>
<li>Emotional appeal<ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to fear</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Genetic fallacy</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to irrelevant authority</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ad hominem</strong></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to hypocrisy</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it's a good idea to organize ideas like this. It shows
clearly, for example, how many "different" fallacies are fundamentally
red herrings, according to the author. It also helps draw out that the
names of the fallacies aren't so important; in each case you could
just as well simply explain an argument's problem without using the
name.</p>
<p>It's fun to think about organizing these. Here's a different way I was
thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems with premises<ul>
<li><strong>Circular reasoning</strong> (A implies A is fine; the problem is
   starting with A.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arguing the wrong thing<ul>
<li>Ambiguity<ul>
<li><strong>Equivocation</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Redefinition<ul>
<li><strong>No true Scotsman</strong></li>
<li><strong>Straw man</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>False dilemma</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problems with form of argument (Non Sequitur)<ul>
<li><strong>Affirming the consequent</strong></li>
<li>Weak analogy<ul>
<li>Unrepresentative sample<ul>
<li><strong>Hasty generalization</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Missing data<ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to ignorance</strong></li>

<p>I think red herrings are generally non sequiturs, but they may not
necessarily be fallacies, in a probabilistic sense. Heck, even the
most "logical" fallacy (affirming the consequent) can still count as
evidence for a proposition.</p>
<p>Almossawi does also note on page 40 (ad hominem) "That said, there are
situations where one may legitimately question a person's credibility,
such as during trial testimony."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are
the easiest person to fool. - Richard P. Feynman"</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 4, a reference to Gula's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nonsense-Herrings-Sacred-Everyday-Language/dp/1604191252/">Nonsense</a>, which might be a sort
of non-illustrated/longer version of Bad Arguments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That book reminded me of a list of guidelines that I had scribbled
down in a notebook a decade ago about how to argue; they were the
result of several years of arguing with strangers in online forums
and they included, for example, "Try not to make general claims
about things." That is obvious to me now, but to a schoolboy, it was
an exciting revelation." (page 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"One may reasonably appeal to <em>pertinent</em> authority, as scientists
and academics typically do. A vast majority of the things that we
believe in, such as atoms and the solar system, are on reliable
authority, as are all historical statements, to paraphrase C. S.
Lewis."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> "was a British writer and lay theologian" - is
Almossawi paraphrasing him on the appeal to authority as a joke? Not
that the claim is wrong, just that it's a funny place to cite an
unrelated figure.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Inductive argument: An <em>argument</em> in which if the <em>premisses</em> are
true, then it is probable that the conclusion will also be true."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what P&#243;lya calls plausible reasoning, maybe to avoid the
confusion with mathematical induction or the specific/general
explanation (which I reject) for deductive/inductive reasoning.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://www.livescience.com/21569-deduction-vs-induction.html">this</a> claim: "Inductive reasoning is the opposite of
deductive reasoning." is not particularly helpful. (This site is heavy
on the "deduction is general to specific, induction is specific to
general".)</p>
<p>This <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/#DedIndAbd">other</a> site has this example of induction: &#8220;John lives in
Chelsea&#8221; and &#8220;Most people living in Chelsea are rich&#8221; gives to &#8220;John
is rich.&#8221; This does not go from specific to general.</p>
<p>Plausible reasoning precedes logical reasoning (Almossawi quotes
Minsky: "Logic no more explains how we think than grammar explains how
we speak") and yet logical fallacies somewhat rudely direct us to
mistrust heuristics that are useful for plausible reasoning. This
relates to the idea of language being a model: the famous syllogism
takes "All men are mortal" as true, but really it's just highly
plausible. You really have to assume the premises.</p>
<p>In fact we could just as well speak of the Inductive Fallacy, and use
it to argue against all manner of things that are understood to be
true.</p>

<title>Bad Choices, by Almossawi</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I enjoyed Almossawi's illustrated introduction to computational
thinking, which is <a href="https://bookofbadchoices.com/">freely available</a> online. I've been <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/issues/198">thinking</a>
about non-fiction(ish) books for kids, and this one could be read by
middle-schoolers, I think, and possibly spark interest in learning
more. It illustrates the challenges and rewards of telling stories
about computer science topics.</p>
<hr>
<p>Almossawi has one of his distinctive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind map</a>s toward the end of
the book. Linearized, the topics in the book look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals<ul>
<li>Stacks</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Linked lists</li>
<li>Asymptotic notation</li>
<li>Worst, average cases</li>
</ul>

<li>Searching<ul>
<li>Binary search</li>
<li>Linear search</li>
<li>Hash tables</li>

<blockquote>
<p>"Note that all the lines in this book are plotted on a log-log
scale, which is why the shapes of the lines are the way they are."

</blockquote>
<p>I would have liked to see this better explained. The lines are never
labeled, and I'm not sure why this was intentional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The lines in those graphs were intentionally unlabeled." (page 137)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless it was for this reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In my experience, any learning environment that encourages students
to be fast learners is setting its students up for failure." (page
xi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's interesting, but I'm not sure it's a good justification. At
least, I think it would be good to be explicit, like: "Add your own
labels to these," if that's what the reader is supposed to do.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you look at human history, you're likely to find that many of

<title>Anki is easy</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)">Anki</a>, named after the Japanese for "memorization," is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> flashcard app. I've been interested in it
before, but I didn't jump in because it seemed like a commitment to
install it and be an Anki person. It turns out you don't need to
install anything, you can use <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">AnkiWeb</a> for free online, so I've
started adding cards and it's fun!</p>
<p>Now I keep an <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">AnkiWeb</a> tab open and add things I want to remember
as I come across them. A failure mode I experienced playing with
similar software in the past was adding pre-made decks of cards from
other people, which leads to frustration and just not caring about
them. Much better to add just occasional things that you care about.</p>
<p>Now instead of just complaining about my memory, I'm also doing
something about it!</p>

<title>Fusion isn't so hard</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I saw somebody <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/amp/news/2020/10/middle-school-student-achieved-nuclear-fusion-in-his-family-playroom-631163">post</a> about a kid achieving nuclear fusion at home,
and I was sure it was fake news. It referenced <a href="https://fusor.net/">fusor.net</a>, which
also looks fake. But the concept, at least, is real!
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor">WikiPedia</a>/<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/nuclear/fusion-on-a-budget">IEEE</a>) How cool! For a couple thousand dollars or
so, you can make a fusion reactor in your house, on a desk! I feel
like this should be more widely known.</p>
<p>You mostly hear about fusion in stars, which makes it seem... big. And
far away. Knowing you can do it as a hobbyist if you feel like makes
it seem so much more approachable! Together with the naturally
occurring fission <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/natures-nuclear-reactors-the-2-billion-year-old-natural-fission-reactors-in-gabon-western-africa/">reactors</a>, there are cool non-bomb, non-star
examples of both fission and fusion. Nice!</p>
<p>Also did you know you can buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium">deuterium</a>? I think you can probably
get it as a gas, but you can also just buy yourself some heavy water
if you want! It's just water, but with extra neutrons on the hydrogen!
How cool!</p>
<p>The good and bad of home fusion is that it's just a <em>little</em> bit of
fusion, and it takes a lot more energy to make it happen than you get
out. So it doesn't blow up, and the extra radioactivity won't kill you
very fast. As far as I can tell, these fusor devices are in a weird
zone of not being regulated, I think, because they're hard enough to
make and not quite dangerous enough to be a big risk.</p>
<p>I think it'd be a great thing to see more fusors in children's museums
(and other science museums). They don't have to turn it on; it'd just
be a cool exhibit to demonstrate that it's so possible.</p>

<title>Give the model epistemology</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Jaskie has a nice paper with
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9048765">A Modified Logistic Regression for Positive and Unlabeled Learning</a>.
I like that it extends the usual logistic function in a way that
captures the idea that labels may be incorrect. I wonder about
extending the idea to multi-class softmax, and its relationship with
label smoothing.</p>
<p>Here's the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic function</a>.</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ 1 }{ 1 + e^{-x} } \tag{1} \]</p>
<p>What Jaskie does is introduce another term in the denominator:</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ 1 }{ 1 + b^2 + e^{-x} } \tag{2} \]</p>
<p>The \( b \) term is squared to be non-negative, and learned during
model fitting. The effect is that the maximum score for a positive
example is less than one.</p>
<p>This makes sense in the positive unlabeled setting because Jaskie
differentiates between whether an example <em>is</em> positive and whether an
example is <em>labeled</em> positive. We only have the labels, and we know
that some positive examples may not be positively labeled, so the
probability based on the example that it is positively labeled is less
than one.</p>
<p>It's somewhat surprising that this seems to work quite well, as
demonstrated (for example) in Jaskie's Figure 6. (SLR is Standard
Logistic Regression, MLR is Jaskie's Modified Logistic Regression.)</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 6" src="figure_6.png"></p>
<p>Let's speculate about extending this idea to the multi-class setting.
First, just moving things around, Equation 2 becomes Equation 3.</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ e^x }{ (1 + b^2) e^x + 1 } \tag{3} \]</p>
<p>That form makes it easy to see the analogy between the usual logistic
function and the multi-class <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">softmax</a>. Then the natural thing to
suggest is Equation 4.</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ e^{x_i} }{ \sum (1 + b_i^2) e^{x_i} } \tag{4} \]</p>
<p>The semi-supervised setting in which there's a pile of unlabeled data
in addition to the labeled data is pretty common, especially when
labeling is expensive, and if something relatively simple like this
were to give similar performance benefits to Jaskie's binary case, it
could easily become very popular. (Assume you have a "garbage" class
as well, in the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/task/open-set-learning">open set</a> sense.)</p>
<p>There's probably a similar extension to keep the negative example
scores from going all the way to zero, if you think some of the true
negatives might have incorrectly positive labels (or otherwise wrong
labels in the multi-class setting).</p>
<p>I wonder about the relationship between these techniques and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02629">label smoothing</a>... With smoothed labels you still have fixed (or
at least sort of balanced) target probabilities, whereas the above
techniques allow learning where the targets should be... But I think
you wouldn't get the limits on logit growth, with the above
techniques... It would be neat if the above techniques gave you good
calibration <em>and</em> informative logits in the distillation sense. Hmm!</p>

<title>Drawbridge Up, by Enzensberger</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Drawbridge-Up-Mathematics-Cultural-Anathema/dp/156881156X">talk</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Magnus_Enzensberger">the author of The Number Devil</a> is unfortunately
hard to find at a reasonable price. It's a beautiful short version of
the not uncommon sentiment that math should be more widely
appreciated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Short: Drawbridge Up, by Enzensberger</li>
<li>Medium: <a href="/20200909-mathematicians_lament_by_lockhart/">A Mathematician's Lament, by Lockhart</a></li>
<li>Long: <a href="//20200925-how_not_to_be_wrong_by_ellenberg/">How Not to Be Wrong, by Ellenberg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mumford">Mumford</a>'s preface is <a href="https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/beyond/education.html">available</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am accustomed, as a professional mathematician, to living in a
sort of vacuum, surrounded by people who, as in the first paragraph
of Enzensberger's essay, declare with an odd sort of pride that they
are mathematically illiterate. How astonishing to come to the
International Congress and find a distinguished poet and essayist
who analyzes this problem with such a deep understanding and
sensitivity. This is a beautiful essay and great delight for a
mathematician to read. Here the strange contradictions with which we
live are laid bare with accuracy of a dissecting microscope. He is
onto our schizophrenic world in which, with one hand, we take pride
in building an elegant world utterly divorced from the demands of
reality and, with the other, claim that our ideas underlie virtually
all technological developments of significance. I was particularly
pleased to find that he believes progress is possible in teaching
mathematics, that it can be made exciting to young minds. I tried
(unsuccessfully) to get each high school in which my children were
enrolled to go outside during geometry class and find out how tall
the oak in the yard really is. Instead they buckled under to the
establishment and even removed that staple of my generation: the odd
formulaic Euclidean-style proof in which the pedigree of each step
was detailed. This old game, the one piece of high school
mathematics often mentioned warmly by people who otherwise hated
math, had been found wanting by the mathematical puritans described
in the Stewart quote, where the mathematician is unwilling to "lie a
bit, like everyone else does". I hope the right people read this
essay -- the movers and shakers of school curricula -- and that it
moves them to let a hundred flowers bloom in the classroom."</p>

<title>Definitional and Computational Sum of Squares are equal</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The definitional (or conceptual) and computational forms of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_sum_of_squares">sum of squared deviations from the mean</a> are equivalent, as in
Equation 1.</p>
<p>\[ SS = \sum \left( x - \overline{x} \right)^2 =
         \sum x^2 - \frac{ \left( \sum x \right)^2 }{ N } \tag{1} \]</p>
<p>We have \( N \) numbers \( x_i \). Their mean is \( \overline{x} \).</p>
<p>\[ \overline{x} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i }{ N }  \tag{2} \]</p>
<p>The limits of every sum here are the same, and always range over the
numbers \( x_i \), so the limits and subscript \( i \) are not
shown outside of Equation 2.</p>
<p>The sum of squared deviations from the mean is defined as in Equation
1.</p>
<p>\[ \sum \left( x - \overline{x} \right)^2 \tag{3} \]</p>
<p>Distributing and rearranging, Expression 3 is the same as Expression
4.</p>
<p>\[ \sum \left( x^2 + \overline{x} \left( \overline{x} - 2x \right) \right) \tag{4} \]</p>
<p>Considering the properties of sums, Expression 4 can be re-written as
Expression 5.</p>
<p>\[ \sum x^2 + \overline{x} \left( \sum \overline{x} -2 \sum x \right) \tag{5} \]</p>
<p>The mean \( \overline{x} \) is a constant, so summing over it gives
\( N \overline{x} \). As can be seen from Equation 2, the sum over
\( x \) is also \( N \overline{x} \). Using these, Expression 5
becomes Expression 6.</p>
<p>\[ \sum x^2 - N \overline{x}^2 \tag{6} \]</p>
<p>Replacing the mean \( \overline{x} \) with its definition as in
Equation 2, we arrive at the computational form.</p>
<p>\[ \sum x^2 - \frac{ \left( \sum x \right)^2 }{ N } \tag{7} \]</p>
<p>Expression 3 and Expression 7 are therefore equal, as shown in
Equation 1. \( \blacksquare \)</p>
<hr>
<p>I thought about writing this up years ago; here's an old
<a href="old.html">draft</a>. I referred to McDowell's <a href="http://psychology.emory.edu/clinical/mcdowell/PSYCH560/Basics/var.html">derivation</a> (nominally
for variance) in writing the above. The computational form is nice
especially if you're calculating by hand, and is (has been?) sometimes
<a href="http://www.ablongman.com/graziano6e/text_site/MATERIAL/Stats/manvar.htm">taught</a> as a procedure, sort of like long division. I don't think
teaching that is really a good idea, if what you care about is
teaching statistics, but it could be a neat example in the right kind
of course on implementation of algorithms (applied math or CS,
maybe?).</p>

<title>AI Superpowers, by Lee</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>There's a lot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai-Fu_Lee">Kai-fu Lee</a> isn't wrong about in <a href="https://www.aisuperpowers.com/">AI Superpowers</a>.
The major break-through of deep learning has occurred, and
applications are now more engineering than invention (cf. <a href="/20200728-technological_revolutions_and_financial_capital/">Perez</a>).
China has data, entrepreneurs, engineers, and government support for
AI. Compared to the US, China has fewer ethical qualms and democratic
controls, which Lee propagandizes as advantages for China. I think
he's right that we should worry more about human society than about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a>, but I think he exaggerates the exceptionalism of AI.</p>
<p>The boundary between AI and non-AI computing isn't clear. There have
been industrial robots for years. Does it matter whether Google search
is powered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)">BERT</a>? It's hard to pin down exactly
what's AI and what isn't. But this isn't my main objection.</p>
<p>There has <em>already been</em> a trend toward concentration of corporate
power, economic inequality, and unemployment/underemployment. The main
problem with Harari's "<a href="https://ideas.ted.com/the-rise-of-the-useless-class/">useless class</a>" idea is his use of the
future tense. The useless class is here already.</p>
<p>It might be better to discuss issues of the future of society in
connections with AI rather than not at all, but I worry that the focus
on AI can distract from trends and approaches that aren't tied to AI.
It isn't useful to make new AI a scapegoat for existing phenomena.</p>
<p>I think Lee overestimates the magnitude of AI's direct impact on jobs,
but maybe not the magnitude of the overall trend in jobs. Regardless,
he then spends the back of the book opining on public policy after his
come-to-Jesus (not literally) experience with cancer. He praises
volunteers and then proposes that we must pay people for things they
would volunteer to do if they didn't have to worry about money. I
don't oppose paying teachers (etc.) more, but I think he's
fundamentally wrong about how humans work, and I think he's way
outside his area of expertise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In my view, that [Chinese/US] lead in AI development will translate
into productivity gains on a scale not seen since the Industrial
Revolution." (page 18)</p>

<p>"Based on the current trends in technology advancement and adoption,
I predict that within fifteen years, artificial intelligence will
technically be able to replace around 40 to 50 percent of jobs in
the United States. Actual job losses may end up lagging those
technical capabilities by an additional decade, but I forecast that
the disruption to job markets will be very real, very large, and
coming soon." (page 19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Published in 2018, so that's capability by 2033 and job losses by
2043.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The AI world order will combine winner-take-all economics with an
unprecedented concentration of wealth in the hands of a few
companies in China and the United States. This, I believe, is the
real underlying threat posed by artificial intelligence: tremendous
social disorder and political collapse stemming from widespread
unemployment and gaping inequality." (page 21)</p>

of Israeli judges found them far more severe in their decision

meal." (page 116)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if this well-known judge study were replicated and broadly
believed (which it is <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/impossibly-hungry-judges">not</a>), Lee's reference is still rather
appalling excuse-making for racist algorithms.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Chinese and American internet companies have taken different
approaches to winning local markets,
[China supporting local companies, America expanding into markets directly]

they may engage in proxy competition in countries like India,
Indonesia, and parts of the Middle East and Africa." (page 139)</p>

<p>"We looked at technical fixes that seek to smooth the transition to
an AI economy: retraining workers, reducing work hours, and
redistributing income through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income">UBI</a>. While all of these
technical fixes have a role to play, I believe something more is
needed. I envision the private sector creatively fostering
human-machine symbiosis, a new wave of impact investing funding
human-centric service jobs, and the government filling the gaps with
a social investment stipend that rewards care, service, and
education." (page 224-225)</p>

<title>How Not to Be Wrong, by Ellenberg</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I like <a href="https://www.jordanellenberg.com/how-not-to-be-wrong/">this book</a> a lot. The five parts (Linearity, Inference,
Expectation, Regression, Existence) provide beautiful large-scale
structure, and it also shimmers on every page. Supreme Court justices
encounter the word "orthogonal." There's a beautiful proof of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem">Buffon's needle problem</a>. There's some philosophy of math.
Ellenberg is a delight.</p>
<p>In some ways, How Not to Be Wrong is like a long version of
<a href="/20200909-mathematicians_lament_by_lockhart/">Lockhart's exultation</a>, with examples. Lockhart extols the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion">method of exhaustion</a>; Ellenberg teaches it. The author clearly
loves math, and shares it generously with the reader.</p>
<p>The "How Not to Be Wrong" is delivered by exposing numerous common
fallacies or errors in understanding. Not every phenomenon is linear.
"Don't talk about percentages of numbers when the numbers might be
negative." "Improbable things happen a lot," and that affects how you
should think about significance tests and related things. The book is
a joy to read, I'd also read a "handbook" version collecting just the
main ideas.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Selected quotations and (rarely) comments</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Those [homework] integrals are to mathematics as weight training
and calisthenics are to soccer. If you want to play soccer&#8212;I mean,
<em>really play</em>, at a competitive level&#8212;you've got to do a lot of
boring, repetitive, apparently pointless drills." (page 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Math is woven into the way we reason." (page 2)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Here's an old mathematician's trick that makes the picture
perfectly clear: <em>set some variables to zero</em>." (pages 6-7)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"What assumptions are you making? And are they justified?" (page 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mathematics <em>is</em> common sense." (page 10)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mathematicians like to give names to the phenomena our common sense
describes: instead of saying &#8220;<em>This</em> thing added to <em>that</em> thing is
the <em>same</em> thing as <em>that</em> thing added to <em>this</em> thing,&#8221; we say
&#8220;Addition is commutative.&#8221;" (page 11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a philosophy similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Mathematics_Comes_From">Where Mathematics Comes From</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We tend to teach mathematics as a long list of rules. You learn
them in order and you have to obey them, because if you don&#8217;t obey
them you get a C-. <em>This is not mathematics.</em> Mathematics is the
study of things that come out a certain way because there is no
other way they could possibly be." (page 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The specialized language in which mathematicians converse with one
another is a magnificent tool for conveying complex ideas precisely
and swiftly. But its foreignness can create among outsiders the
impression of a sphere of thought totally alien to ordinary
thinking. That's exactly wrong." (page 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mathematics is the extension of common sense by other means." (page
13)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"School mathematics is largely made up of a sequence of facts and
rules, facts which are certain, rules which come from a higher
authority and cannot be questioned." (page 14)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mathematics is not settled." (page 14)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"(Aside: it's important to point out here that people with
out-of-the-mainstream ideas who compare themselves to Edison and
Galileo are <em>never actually right</em>. I get letters with this kind of
language at least once a month, usually from people who have
&#8220;proofs&#8221; of mathematical statements that have been known for
hundreds of years to be false. I can guarantee you Einstein did not
go around telling people, &#8220;Look, I know this theory of general
relativity sounds wacky, but that's what they said about Galileo!&#8221;)"

government revenue;"</p>
<p>"Therefore, <em>it is</em> the case that lowering taxes will increase
government revenue." (page 30)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Working an integral or performing a linear regression is something
a computer can do quite effectively. Understanding whether the
result makes sense&#8212;or deciding whether the method is the right one
to use in the first place&#8212;requires a guiding human hand. When we
teach mathematics we are supposed to be explaining how to be that
guide. A math course that fails to do so is essentially training the
student to be a very slow, buggy version of Microsoft Excel." (page
56)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"there are algorithms I think we can safely discard in the modern
world. We don't need to teach students how to extract square roots
by hand, or in their head ..." (page 57)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Of course it's no better (in fact, it's substantially worse) to
pass along a population of students who've developed some wispy
sense of mathematical meaning but can't work examples swiftly and
correctly. A math teacher's least favorite thing to hear from a
student is &#8220;I get the concept, but I couldn't do the problems.&#8221;
Though the student doesn't know it, this is shorthand for &#8220;I don't
get the concept.&#8221; The ideas of mathematics can sound abstract, but
they make sense only in reference to concrete computations. William
Carlos Williams put it crisply: <em>no ideas but in things</em>." (page 58)</p>

<p>"If a tiny state like South Dakota experiences a rash of brain
cancer, you might presume that the spike is in large measure due to
luck, and you might estimate that the rate of brain cancer in the
future is likely to be closer to the overall national number. You
could accomplish this by taking some kind of weighted average of the
South Dakota rate with the national rate. But how to weight the two
numbers? That's a bit of an art, involving a fair amount of
technical labor I'll spare you here." (pages 70-71)</p>

<p>I think he's referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model">multi-level modeling</a>, in the Gelman
style.</p>

<p>"When we are scientists, or Torah scholars, or toddlers gaping at
the clouds, we are presented with <em>observations</em> and asked to build
<em>theories</em>&#8211;what went into the box to produce the world that we see?
Inference is a hard thing, maybe the hardest thing." (page 110)</p>

<p>Ellenberg says "inference" but I might say "abduction."</p>
<hr>
<p>Dangers of comparing very small rates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... <em>twice a tiny number is a tiny number</em>. How good or bad it is
to double something depends on how big that something is!" (page
120)</p>
<p>"Risk ratios are much easier for the brain to grasp than tiny
splinters of probability like 1 in 7,000. But risk ratios applied to
small probabilities can easily mislead you." (page 120)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The truth is, the null hypothesis, if we take it literally, is
probably just about always false." (page 120)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If only we could go back in time to the dawn of statistical
nomenclature and declare that a result passing Fisher's test with a
p-value of less than 0.05 was &#8220;statistically noticeable&#8221; or
&#8220;statistically detectable&#8221; instead of &#8220;statistically significant&#8221;!
That would be truer to the meaning of the method, which merely
counsels us about the existence of an effect but is silent about its
size or importance. But it's too late for that. We have the language
we have." (page 121)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"It has come to my attention that hardly anybody knows what the
logarithm is. Let me take a step toward fixing this. The logarithm
of a positive number <em>N</em>, called <em>log N</em>, is the number of digits it
has." (page 139)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to call this the "fake logarithm," of "flogarithm."</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In particular, the view that the primary concern of statistics is
making decisions is more closely associated with Neyman than with
Pearson." (page 159)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The p-value is the answer to the question</p>
<p>""The chance that the observed experimental result would occur,
given that the null hypothesis is correct."</p>
<p>"But what we <em>want</em> to know is the other conditional probability:</p>
<p>""The chance that the null hypothesis is correct, given that we
observed a certain experimental result."" (page 170)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is connected to Bayesian stats as "inverse probability", and he
also notes that it's referred to as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor%27s_fallacy">the prosecutor's fallacy</a>" and
references the book <em>Math on Trial</em>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"no scientific worker has a fixed level of significance at which
from year to year, and in all circumstances, he rejects hypotheses;
he rather gives his mind to each particular case in the light of his
evidence and his ideas" (page 180, quoting Fisher)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saying that even Fisher thinks our prior beliefs enter our work;
Fisher just has certain ideas about when it's appropriate to invoke
probability: he insists on some actual chance process.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We tend to like simpler theories better than more complicated ones;
theories that rest on analogies to things we already know about
better than theories that posit totally novel phenomena." (page 182)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... you have to be careful about the universe of theories you
consider. Just as there may be more than one solution to a quadratic
equation, there may be multiple theories that give rise to the same
observation, and if we don't consider them all, our inferences may
lead us badly astray." (page 185)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
impossible, whatever remains, however improbably, must be the truth,
unless the truth is a hypothesis it didn't occur to me to consider."

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"And as much as I love Bayesian inference, I think people are
probably best off arriving at their faith, or discarding it, in a
non-quantitative way." (page 191)</p>

<p>"Expected value is not the value you expect" (page 198)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/Abrams2011.pdf">Finding Good Bets in the Lottery, and Why You Shouldn&#8217;t Take Them</a> is a great reference, which I connect to my <a href="/2012/06/04/expected-value-is-not-useful-for-making/">Expected value is not useful for making decisions about lottery tickets</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Any given ticket is probably worthless, but if you've got a
thousand tickets, it's essentially certain that you'll make your
money back and then some." (page 209)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gets at what I think is important: It isn't the expected value
you care about, it's your probability of being in a state that doesn't
suck. You want P(losing money) to become negligible, and that can
happen if you have positive expected value <em>and</em> enough tickets.</p>
<hr>

<p>The doctrine of expected utility is appealingly straightforward and
simple: presented with a set of choices, pick the one with the
highest expected utility. It is perhaps the closest thing we have to
a simple mathematical theory of individual decision making. And it
captures many features of the way humans make choices, which is why
it remains a central part of the quantitative social scientist's
tool kit. (page 248)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the decision-theory literature, the former kind of unknown is
called <em>risk</em>, the latter <em>uncertainty</em>." (page 251)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The former is known unknowns (30% chance of drawing a black ball) and
the latter is unknown unknowns (maybe we're wrong about what the
chance is).</p>

weak understanding of patent laws because, regularly, things that

always maintained that excepting fools, men did not differ much in

eminently important difference." (page 300, quoting Charles Darwin's
letter to his cousin Francis Galton on the effect of reading
Galton's "Hereditary Genius")</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Ellenberg includes a fun table of Galton's on page 316, which has the
character of a visualization in that you can see an ellipse, sort of
like a two-dimensional stem and leaf plot...</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_anthropometry#Forensic_anthropometry">Bertillonage</a> (page 325) is kind of interesting and can be related

<blockquote>
<p>"Mathematicians ever since Descartes have enjoyed the wonderful
freedom to flip back and forth between algebraic and geometric
descriptions of the world. The advantage of algebra is that it's
easier to formalize and to type into a computer. The advantage of
geometry is that it allows us to bring our physical intuition to
bear on the situation, particularly when you can draw a picture. I
seldom feel I <em>really</em> understand a piece of mathematics until I
know what it's about in geometric language." (page 336)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This relates to "The Rule of Three" in the McCallum et al. <em>Multivariable Calculus</em>:</p>

<p>"Every topic should be presented geometrically, numerically and
algebraically." (page v)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"It may sound impressive that we can do geometry in ten dimensions
(or a hundred, or a million...), but the mental pictures we keep in
our mind are two- or at most three-dimensional. That's all our
brains can handle. Fortunately, this impoverished vision is usually
enough." (page 338)</p>

<p>"Correlation is not transitive. It's more like "blood relation"&#8211;I'm
related to my son, who's related to my wife, but my wife and I

idea to think of correlated variables as "sharing part of their

<p>"Undecided voters, by and large, aren't undecided because they're
carefully weighing the merits of each candidate, unprejudiced by
political dogma. They're undecided because they're barely paying

<hr>
<p>A section titled "It's not always wrong to be wrong" on page 354

it turns out later that a risk isn't as previously believed.</p>

<p>Ellenberg's immediate (and real, October 2010) example:</p>

<ul>
<li>37% favor repeal of ACA</li>
<li>10% favor weakening ACA</li>
<li>15% favor maintaining ACA</li>
<li>36% favor expanding ACA</li>

want <em>more extreme</em> policy than ACA, not less.</p>

<title>Trivia rewards test-time effort</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I've been a casual <a href="https://www.learnedleague.com/">LearnedLeague</a> trivia player for a while. I was
inspired by <a href="/20200716-lateral_thinking_creativity_step_by_step/">Lateral Thinking</a> (the book) to try typing out
"conversations with myself" as I thought about the questions during
season 86. I didn't study or change anything else. Directing effort
during question-answering seems to have helped me answer more
questions correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#sure">Am I sure I did better?</a></li>
<li><a href="#diff">What did I do differently?</a></li>
<li><a href="#obvious">Is the benefit of effort obvious?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="SchumacherA correct answers per season" src="tca.png"></p>
<p><em>There are four LearnedLeague seasons per year, each with 25 match
days of 6 questions each. My performance has ranged from 34 to 66
correct out of 150, or 22.7% to 44.0% correct.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="sure"></a>Am I sure I did better?</h3>
<p>A change in question difficulty could also lead to me getting more
right. I've been in Rundle E for all the seasons shown, which means
I'm in with a bunch of other casual players. Since the mix of people
isn't likely to suddenly change, the performance of my opponents is a
rough control for question difficulty. Looking at the difference
between my number of correct answers and my opponents', the season 86
improvement is still clear.</p>
<p><img alt="SchumacherA correct answer differential per season" src="cadiff.png"></p>
<p>Looking at the league-wide correct answer percentage, it does seem
that this season was slightly easier than last season, but the
difference is small (50.71% vs. 49.06%). There are fancier ways to try
to control for question difficulty, but I'm satisfied that the change
in my performance isn't primarily due to changes in question
difficulty.</p>
<p>I also don't think the change is explained by a gradual process of
natural learning over time. I don't see any compelling pattern in the
first fifteen data points.</p>
<p>If you assume the earlier 15 season results were samples from the same
distribution, my season 86 result is very unlikely to arise from that
distribution by chance (p-value well under 0.01) for either view of
the data. (<a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/blob/master/20200924-trivia_rewards_effort/analyze.ipynb">calculations</a>)</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="diff"></a>What did I do differently?</h3>
<p>Previously, I'd look at the questions online, think about them, and
write in my answers. For season 86, I inserted an extra step. I copied
the questions into a text file on my computer, and I typed out my
thinking process, using lots of question marks and thinking of lots of
related things, even sometimes free-associating.</p>
<p>Here's an example <a href="https://www.learnedleague.com/question.php?86&amp;7&amp;1">question</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decade of chaos and political upheaval in China that began in
1966, grounded in a factional conflict over the future of Chinese
socialism, and ended with Mao's death in 1976, is best known in the
west as what "Revolution"?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not a hard question, but I didn't remember the answer at first.
In fact, I had a wrong answer that I was nearly ready to use. Here's
what I wrote in my file:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Children's? Somehow I think "Children's Revolution"... Was that
something from 3 Body Problem? Seems like a weird revolution name.
What else... Green Revolution was/is a big agriculture thing... That
other Chinese thing is "The Great Leap Forward" when lots of people
died... Mao's Revolution? People's Revolution? Socialist Revolution?
Weird Revolution? Party Revolution? Dance Dance Revolution? Red
Revolution? "It was known in the west as the ..." Decade? 10-year
Revolution? Slow revolution? Is it named after a leader? Other than
Mao? Cultural Revolution? Hmm... That sounds right somehow. Great
Leap Forward, Cultural Revolution... both of those sound like
history things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took me a while to finally get to the right answer. If I hadn't
been writing things out like this, I might have just written down my
first guess. There were many questions like this, when I felt like the
extra process helped me get to a correct answer.</p>
<p>The extra process also led to me getting more mentally and emotionally
involved in the season. I felt like I was doing a little bit better,
and it made me care more. A seemingly mechanical task change ended up
increasing my motivation.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="obvious"></a>Is the benefit of effort obvious?</h3>
<p>In the extreme, low effort can lead to scores of zero, so effort
certainly has some effect. But I've never "blown off" LearnedLeague;
I've always tried to answer as best I can. So the possibly surprising
thing is that I was able to improve markedly from that baseline.</p>
<p>Trivia is pretty close to a pure knowledge test: "either you know it
or you don't." It isn't surprising that performance improves with
study in advance, and it isn't surprising that performance varies by
person based on strength of memory, etc. But it might be surprising
that performance can vary for an individual, depending on approach
during the test itself.</p>
<p>If performance changes measurably on a task like this, how much more
so for process tasks like mathematics? How large must be the
contribution to a student's standardized test scores from motivation
and focus on a particular day?</p>
<p>On the other hand, the observed effect doesn't move me at all into the
ranks of the strongest competitors on LearnedLeague, who routinely get
70% of questions correct, compared to my new record of 44%.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the effect is large enough that it seems like it
matters, and it certainly matters psychologically to me. Something
like a <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">growth mindset</a>, it motivates me a lot more to think about
LearnedLeague as something that responds to effort, rather than just a
test of what I happen to know... It's more like climbing a rope than
checking oil with a dipstick. (More like climbing a rope than
measuring a rope? I'm liking this image...)</p>

<title>Axiomatic Thinking (Hilbert, 1918)</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I had difficulty finding this online, so I'm posting it here for
reference.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="#1" name="1">&#182;</a> Just as in the life of nations the
individual nation can only thrive when all neighbouring nations are in
good health; and just as the interest of states demands, not only that
order prevail within every individual state, but also that the
relationships of the states among themselves be in good order; so it
is in the life of the sciences. In due recognition of this fact the
most important bearers of mathematical thought have always evinced
great interest in the laws and the structure of the neighbouring
sciences; above all for the benefit of mathematics itself they have
always cultivated the relations to the neighbouring sciences,
especially to the great empires of physics and epistemology. I believe
that the essence of these relations, and the reason for their
fruitfulness, will appear most clearly if I describe for you the
general method of research which seems to be coming more and more into
its own in modern mathematics: I mean the <em>axiomatic method</em>.</p>
<p><a href="#2" name="2">&#182;</a> When we assemble the facts of a definite,
more-or-less comprehensive field of knowledge, we soon notice that
these facts are capable of being ordered. This ordering always comes
about with the help of a certain <em>framework of concepts</em>
[<em>Fachwerk von Begriffen</em>] in the following way: a concept of this
framework corresponds to each individual object of the field of
knowledge, and a logical relation between concepts corresponds to
every fact within the field of knowledge. The framework of concepts is
nothing other than the <em>theory</em> of the field of knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="#3" name="3">&#182;</a> Thus the facts of geometry order
themselves into a geometry, the facts of arithmetic into a theory of
numbers, the facts of statics, mechanics, electrodynamics into a
theory of statics, mechanics, electrodynamics, or the facts from the
physics of gases into a theory of gases. It is precisely the same with
the fields of knowledge of thermodynamics, geometrical optics,
elementary radiation-theory, the conduction of heat, or also with the
calculus of probabilities or the theory of sets. It even holds of
special fields of knowledge in pure mathematics, such as the theory of
surfaces, the theory of Galois equations, and the theory of prime
numbers, no less than for several fields of knowledge that lie far
from mathematics, such as certain parts of psychophysics or the theory
of money.</p>
<p><a href="#4" name="4">&#182;</a> If we consider a particular theory more
closely, we always see that a few distinguished propositions of the
field of knowledge underlie the construction of the framework of
concepts, and these propositions then suffice by themselves for the
construction, in accordance with logical principles, of the entire
framework.</p>
<p><a href="#5" name="5">&#182;</a> Thus in geometry the proposition of the
linearity of the equation of the plane and of the orthogonal
transformation of point-coordinates is completely adequate to produce
the whole broad science of spatial Euclidean geometry purely by means
of analysis. Moreover, the laws of calculation and the rules for
integers suffice for the construction of number theory. In statics the
same role is played by the proposition of the parallelogram of forces;
in mechanics, say, by the Lagrangian differential equations of motion;
and in electrodynamics by the Maxwell equations together with the
requirement of the rigidity and charge of the electron. Thermodynamics
can be completely built up from the concept of energy function and the
definition of temperature and pressure as derivatives of its
variables, entropy and volume. At the heart of the elementary theory
of radiation is Kirchhoff's theorem on the relationships between
emission and absorption; in the calculus of probabilities the Gaussian
law of errors is the fundamental proposition; in the theory of gases,
the proposition that entropy is the negative logarithm of the
probability of the state; in the theory of surfaces, the
representation of the element of arc by the quadratic differential
form; in the theory of equations, the proposition concerning the
existence of roots; in the theory of prime numbers, the proposition
concerning the reality and frequency of Rieman's function &#120577;(s).</p>
<p><a href="#6" name="6">&#182;</a> These fundamental propositions can be
regarded from an initial standpoint as the <em>axioms of the individual
fields of knowledge</em>: the progressive development of the individual
field of knowledge then lies solely in the further logical
construction of the already mentioned framework of concepts. This
standpoint is especially predominant in pure mathematics, and to the
corresponding manner of working we owe the mighty development of
geometry, of arithmetic, of the theory of functions, and of the whole
of analysis.</p>
<p><a href="#7" name="7">&#182;</a> Thus in the cases mentioned above the
problem of grounding the individual field of knowledge had found a
solution; but this solution was only temporary. In fact, in the
individual fields of knowledge the need arose to ground the
fundamental axiomatic propositions themselves. So one acquired
'proofs' of the linearity of the equation of the plane and the
orthogonality of the transformation expressing a movement, of the laws
of arithmetical calculation, of the parallelogram of forces, of the
Lagrangian equations of motion, of Kirchhoff's law regarding emission
and absorption, of the law of entropy, and of the proposition
concerning the existence of roots of an equation.</p>
<p><a href="#8" name="8">&#182;</a> But critical examination of these 'proofs'
shows that they are not in themselves proofs, but basically only make
it possible to trace things back to certain deeper propositions, which
in turn are now to be regarded as new axioms instead of the
propositions to be proved. The actual so-called <em>axioms</em> of geometry,
arithmetic, statics, mechanics, radiation theory, or thermodynamics
arose in this way. These axioms form a layer of axioms which lies
deeper than the axiom-layer given by the recently-mentioned
fundamental theorems of the individual field of knowledge. The
procedure of the axiomatic method, as it is expressed here, amounts to
a <em>deepening of the foundations</em> of the individual domains of
knowledge&#8212;a deepening that is necessary for every edifice that one
wishes to expand and to build higher while preserving its stability.</p>
<p><a href="#9" name="9">&#182;</a> If the theory of a field of knowledge&#8212;that
is, the framework of concepts that represents it&#8212;is to serve its
purpose of orienting and ordering, then it must satisfy two
requirements above all: <em>first</em> it should give us an overview of the
<em>independence</em> and <em>dependence</em> of the propositions of the theory;
<em>second</em>, it should give us a guarantee of the <em>consistency</em> of all
the propositions of the theory. In particular, the axioms of each
theory are to be examined from these two points of view.</p>
<p><a href="#10" name="10">&#182;</a> Let us first consider the independence
or dependence of the axioms.</p>
<p><a href="#11" name="11">&#182;</a> The <em>axiom of parallels</em> in geometry is
the classical example of the independence of an axiom. When he placed
the parallel postulate among the axioms, Euclid thereby denied that
the proposition of parallels is implied by the other axioms. Euclid's
method of investigation became the paradigm for axiomatic research,
and since Euclid geometry has been the prime example of an axiomatic
science.</p>
<p><a href="#12" name="12">&#182;</a> Classical mechanics furnishes another
example of an investigation of the independence of axioms. The
Lagrangian equations of motion were temporarily able to count as
axioms of mechanics&#8212;for mechanics can of course be entirely based on
these equations when they are generally formulated for arbitrary
forces and arbitrary side-constraints. But further investigation shows
that it is not necessary in the construction of mechanics to
presuppose arbitrary forces or arbitrary side-constraints; thus the
system of presuppositions can be reduced. This piece of knowledge
leads, on the one hand, to the axiom system of Boltzmann, who assumes
only forces (and indeed special central forces) but no
side-constraints, and the axiom system of Hertz, who discards forces
and makes do with side-constraints (and indeed special
side-constraints with rigid connections). These two axiom systems form
a deeper layer in the progressive axiomatization of mechanics.</p>
<p><a href="#13" name="13">&#182;</a> If in establishing the theory of Galois
equations we assume as an axiom the existence of roots of an equation,
then this is certainly a dependent axiom; for, as Gauss was the first
to show, that existence theorem can be proved from the axioms of
arithmetic.</p>
<p><a href="#14" name="14">&#182;</a> Something similar would happen if we
were to assume as an axiom in the theory of prime numbers the
proposition about the reality of the zeroes of the Riemann
&#120577;(s)-function: as we progress to a deeper layer of purely arithmetical
axioms the proof of this reality-proposition would become necessary,
and only this proof would guarantee the reliability of the important
conclusions which we have already achieved for the theory of prime
numbers by taking it as a postulate.</p>
<p><a href="#15" name="15">&#182;</a> A particularly interesting question for
axiomatics concerns the independence of the propositions of a field of
knowledge from the axiom of <em>continuity</em>.</p>
<p><a href="#16" name="16">&#182;</a> In the theory of real numbers it is
shown that the axiom of measurement&#8212;the so-called Archimedean axiom&#8212;is
independent of all the other arithmetical axioms. As everybody knows,
this information is of great significance for geometry; but it seems
to me to be of capital interest for physics as well, for it leads to
the following result: the fact that by adjoining terrestrial distances
to one another we can achieve the dimensions and distances of bodies
in outer space (that is, that we can measure heavenly distances with
an earthly yardstick) and the fact that the distances within an atom
can all be expressed in terms of metres&#8212;these facts are not at all a
mere logical consequence of propositions about the congruence of
triangles or about geometric configurations, but are a result of
empirical research. The validity of the Archimedean axiom in nature
stands in just as much need of confirmation by experiment as does the
familiar proposition about the sum of the angles of a triangle.</p>
<p><a href="#17" name="17">&#182;</a> In general, I should like to formulate
the axiom of continuity in physics as follows: 'If for the validity of
a proposition of physics we prescribe any degree of accuracy
whatsoever, then it is possible to indicate small regions within which
the presuppositions that have been made for the proposition may vary
freely, without the deviation of the proposition exceeding the
prescribed degree of accuracy.' This axiom basically does nothing more
than express something that already lies in the essence of experiment;
it is constantly presupposed by the physicists, although it has not
previously been formulated.</p>
<p><a href="#18" name="18">&#182;</a> For example, if one follows Planck and
derives the second law of thermodynamics from the axiom of the
impossibility of a <em>perpetuum mobile of the second sort</em>, then this
axiom of continuity must be used in the derivation.</p>
<p><a href="#19" name="19">&#182;</a> By invoking the theorem that the
continuum can be well-ordered, Hamel has shown in a most interesting
manner that, in the foundations of statics, the axiom of continuity is
necessary for the proof of the theorem concerning the <em>parallelogram
of forces</em>&#8212;at any rate, given the most obvious choice of other axioms.</p>
<p><a href="#20" name="20">&#182;</a> The axioms of classical mechanics can be
deepened if, using the axiom of continuity, one imagines continuous
motion to be decomposed into small straight-line movements caused by
discrete impulses and following one another in rapid succession. One
then applies Bertrand's maximum principle as the essential axiom of
mechanics, according to which the motion that actually occurs after
each impulse is that which maximizes the kinetic energy of the system
with respect to all motions that are compatible with the law of the
conservation of energy.</p>
<p><a href="#21" name="21">&#182;</a> The most recent ways of laying the
foundations of physics&#8212;of electrodynamics in particular&#8212;are all
theories of the continuum, and therefore raise the demand for
continuity in the most extreme fashion. But I should prefer not to
discuss them because the investigations are not yet completed.</p>
<p><a href="#22" name="22">&#182;</a> We shall now examine the second of the
two points of view mentioned above, namely, the question concerning
the <em>consistency</em> of the axioms. This question is obviously of the
greatest importance, for the presence of a contradiction in a theory
manifestly threatens the contents of the entire theory.</p>
<p><a href="#23" name="23">&#182;</a> Even for successful theories that have
long been accepted, it is difficult to know that they are internally
consistent: I remind you of the reversibility and recurrence paradox
in the kinetic theory of gases.</p>
<p><a href="#24" name="24">&#182;</a> It often happens that the internal
consistency of a theory is regarded as obvious, while in reality the
proof requires deep mathematical developments. For example, consider a
problem from the elementary theory of the <em>conduction of heat</em>&#8212;namely,
the distribution of temperatures within a homogeneous body whose
surfaces are maintained at a definite temperature that varies from
place to place: then in fact the requirement that there be an
equilibrium of temperatures involves no internal theoretical
contradiction. But to know this it is necessary to prove that the
familiar boundary-value problem of potential theory is always
solvable; for only this proof shows that a temperature distribution
satisfying the equations of the conduction of heat is at all possible.</p>
<p><a href="#25" name="25">&#182;</a> But particularly in physics it is not
sufficient that the propositions of a theory be in harmony with each
other; there remains the requirement that they not contradict the
propositions of a neighbouring field of knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="#26" name="26">&#182;</a> Thus, as I showed earlier, the axioms of
the elementary theory of radiation can be used to prove not only
<em>Kirchhoff's law</em> of emission and absorption, but also a special law
about the reflection and refraction of individual beams of light,
namely, the law: If two beams of natural light and of the same energy
each fall on the surface separating two media from different sides in
such a way that one beam after its reflection, and the other after its
passage, each have the same direction, then the beam that arises from
uniting the two is also of natural light and of the same energy. This
theorem is, as the facts show, not at all in contradiction with
optics, but can be derived as a conclusion from the electromagnetic
theory of light.</p>
<p><a href="#27" name="27">&#182;</a> As is well known, the results of the
<em>kinetic theory of gases</em> are in full harmony with thermodynamics.</p>
<p><a href="#28" name="28">&#182;</a> Similarly, <em>electrodynamic inertia</em> and
<em>Einsteinian gravitation</em> are compatible with the corresponding
concepts of the classical theories, since the classical concepts can
be conceived as limiting cases of the more general concepts in the new
theories.</p>
<p><a href="#29" name="29">&#182;</a> In contrast, <em>modern quantum theory</em> and
our developing knowledge of the internal structure of the atom have
led to laws which virtually contradict the earlier electrodynamics,
which was essentially built on the Maxwell equations; modern
electrodynamics therefore needs&#8212;as everybody acknowledges&#8212;a new
foundation and essential reformulation.</p>
<p><a href="#30" name="30">&#182;</a> As one can see from what has already
been said, the contradictions that arise in physical theories are
always eliminated by changing the selection of the axioms; the
difficulty is to make the selection so that all the observed physical
laws are logical consequences of the chosen axioms.</p>
<p><a href="#31" name="31">&#182;</a> But matters are different when
contradictions appear in purely theoretical fields of knowledge. Set
theory contains the classic example of such an occurrence, namely, in
the <em>paradox of the set of all sets</em>, which goes back to Cantor. This
paradox is so serious that distinguished mathematicians, for example,
Kronecker and Poincar&#233;, felt compelled by it to deny that set
theory&#8212;one of the most fruitful and powerful branches of knowledge
anywhere in mathematics&#8212;has any justification for existing.</p>
<p><a href="#32" name="32">&#182;</a> But in this precarious state of affairs
as well, the axiomatic method came to the rescue. By setting up
appropriate axioms which in a precise way restricted both the
arbitrariness of the definitions of sets and the admissibility of
statements about their elements, Zermelo succeeded in developing set
theory in such a way that the contradictions disappear, but the scope
and applicability of set theory remain the same.</p>
<p><a href="#33" name="33">&#182;</a> In all previous cases it was a matter of
contradictions that had emerged in the course of the development of a
theory and that needed to be eliminated by a reformulation of the
axiom system. But if we wish to restore the reputation of mathematics
as the exemplar of the most rigorous science it is not enough merely
to avoid the existing contradictions. The chief requirement of the
theory of axioms must go farther, namely, to show that within every
field of knowledge contradictions based on the underlying axiom-system
are <em>absolutely impossible</em>.</p>
<p><a href="#34" name="34">&#182;</a> In accordance with this requirement I
have proved the consistency of the axioms laid down in the <em>Grundlagen
der Geometrie</em> by showing that any contradiction in the consequences
of the geometrical axioms must necessarily apppear in the arithmetic
of the system of real numbers as well.</p>
<p><a href="#35" name="35">&#182;</a> For the fields of physical knowledge
too, it is clearly sufficient to reduce the problem of <em>internal
consistency</em> to the consistency of the arithmetical axioms. Thus I
showed the consistency of the axioms of the <em>elementary theory of
radiation</em> by constructing its axiom system out of analytically
independent pieces&#8212;presupposing in the process the consistency of
analysis.</p>
<p><a href="#36" name="36">&#182;</a> One may and should in some circumstances
proceed similarly in the construction of a mathematical theory. For
example, if in the development of the theory of Galois groups we have
taken the proposition of the <em>existence of roots</em> as an axiom, or if
in the theory of prime numbers we have taken the hypothesis concerning
the <em>reality of the zeros</em> of the Riemann &#120577;(s)-function as an axiom,
then in each case the proof of the consistency of the axiom system
comes down to a proof, using the means of analysis, of the proposition
of the existence of roots or of the Riemann hypothesis concerning
&#120577;(s)&#8212;and only then has the theory been securely completed.</p>
<p><a href="#37" name="37">&#182;</a> The problem of the consistency of the
axiom system for the <em>real numbers</em> can likewise be reduced by the use
of set-theoretic concepts to the same problem for the integers: this
is the merit of the theories of the irrational numbers developed by
Weierstrass and Dedekind.</p>
<p><a href="#38" name="38">&#182;</a> In only two cases is this method of
reduction to another special domain of knowledge clearly not
available, namely, when it is a matter of the axioms for the
<em>integers</em> themselves, and when it is a matter of the foundation of
<em>set theory</em>; for here there is no other discipline besides logic
which it would be possi-ble to invoke.</p>
<p><a href="#39" name="39">&#182;</a> But since the examination of consistency
is a task that cannot be avoided, it appears necessary to axiomatize
logic itself and to prove that number theory and set theory are only
parts of logic.</p>
<p><a href="#40" name="40">&#182;</a> This method was prepared long ago (not
least by Frege's profound investigations); it has been most
successfully explained by the acute mathematician and logician
Russell. One could regard the completion of this magnificent
Russellian enterprise of the <em>axiomatization of logic</em> as the crowning
achievement of the work of axiomatization as a whole.</p>
<p><a href="#41" name="41">&#182;</a> But this completion will require further
work. When we consider the matter more closely we soon recognize that
the question of the consistency of the integers and of sets is not one
that stands alone, but that it belongs to a vast domain of difficult
epistemological questions which have a specifically mathematical tint:
for example (to characterize this domain of questions briefly) the
problem of the <em>solvability in principle of every mathematical
question</em>, the problem of the subsequent <em>checkability</em> of the results
of a mathematical investigation, the question of a <em>criterion of
simplicity</em> for mathematical proofs, the question of the relationship
between <em>content and formalism</em> in mathematics and logic, and finally
the problem of the <em>decidability</em> of a mathematical question in a
finite number of operations.</p>
<p><a href="#42" name="42">&#182;</a> We cannot rest content with the
axiomatization of logic until all questions of this sort and their
interconnections have been understood and cleared up.</p>
<p><a href="#43" name="43">&#182;</a> Among the mentioned questions, the
last&#8212;namely, the one concerning decidability in a finite number of
operations&#8212;is the best-known and the most discussed; for it goes to
the essence of mathematical thought.</p>
<p><a href="#44" name="44">&#182;</a> I should like to increase the interest
in this question by indicating several particular mathematical
problems in which it plays a role.</p>
<p><a href="#45" name="45">&#182;</a> In the theory of <em>algebraic invariants</em>
we have the fundamental theorem that there is always a finite number
of whole rational invariants by means of which all other such
invariants can be represented. In my opinion, my first general proof
of this theorem completely satisfied our requirements of simplicity
and perspicuity; but it is impossible to reformulate this proof so
that we can obtain from it a statable bound for the number of the
finitely many invariants of the full system, let alone obtain an
actual listing of them. Instead, new principles and considerations of
a completely different sort were necessary in order to show that the
construction of the full system of invariants requires only a finite
number of operations, and that this number is less than a bound that
can be stated before the calculation.</p>
<p><a href="#46" name="46">&#182;</a> We see the same thing happening in an
example from the <em>theory of surfaces</em>. It is a fundamental question in
the geometry of surfaces of the fourth order to determine the maximum
number of separate sheets it takes to make up such a surface.</p>
<p><a href="#47" name="47">&#182;</a> The first step towards an answer to this
question is the proof that the number of sheets of a curved surface
must be finite. This can easily be shown function-theoretically as
follows. One assumes the existence of infinitely many sheets, and
selects a point inside each spatial region bounded by a sheet. A point
of accumulation for these infinitely many chosen points would then be
a point of a singularity that is excluded for an algebraic surface.</p>
<p><a href="#48" name="48">&#182;</a> This function-theoretic path does not at
all lead to an upper bound for the number of surface-sheets. For that,
we need instead certain observations on the number of cut-points,
which then show that the number of sheets certainly cannot be greater
than 12.</p>
<p><a href="#49" name="49">&#182;</a> The second method, entirely different
from the first, in turn cannot be applied or transformed to decide
whether a surface of the fourth order with twelve sheets actually
exists.</p>
<p><a href="#50" name="50">&#182;</a> Since a quaternary form of the fourth
order possesses 35 homogeneous coefficients, we can conceive of a
given surface of the fourth order as a point in 34-dimensional space.
The discriminant of the quaternary form of fourth order is of degree
108 in its coefficients; if it is set equal to zero, it accordingly
represents in 34-dimensional space a surface of order 108. Since the
coefficients of the discriminant are themselves determinate integers,
the topological character of the discriminant surface can be precisely
determined by the rules that are familiar to us from 2- and
3-dimensional space; so we can obtain precise information about the
nature and significance of the individual subdomains into which the
discriminant surface partitions the 34-dimensional space. Now, the
surfaces of fourth order represented by points of these subdomains all
certainly possess the same sheet-number; and it is accordingly
possible to establish, by a long and wearying but finite calculation,
whether we have a surface of fourth order with n &#8804; 12 sheets or not.</p>
<p><a href="#51" name="51">&#182;</a> The geometric method just described is
thus a third way of treating our question about the maximum number of
sheets of a surface of the fourth order. It proves the decidability of
this question in a finite number of opera-tions. So in principle an
important demand of our problem has been satisfied: it has been
reduced to a problem of the level of difficulty of determining the \(
10^{(10^{10})} \)th numeral in the decimal expansion for &#120587;&#8212;a task
which is clearly solvable, but which remains unsolved.</p>
<p><a href="#52" name="52">&#182;</a> Rather, it took a profound and difficult
algebraic-geometric investigation by Rohn to show that 11 sheets are
not possible in a surface of the fourth order, while 10 sheets
actually occur. Only this fourth method delivered the full solution of
the problem.</p>
<p><a href="#53" name="53">&#182;</a> These particular discussions show how a
variety of methods of proof can be applied to the same problem, and
they ought to suggest how necessary it is to study the essence of
mathematical proof itself if one wishes to answer such questions as
the one about decidability in a finite number of operations.</p>
<p><a href="#54" name="54">&#182;</a> All such questions of principle, which I
characterized above and of which the question just discussed&#8212;that is,
the question about decidability in a finite number of operations&#8212;was
only the last, seem to me to form an important new field of research
which remains to be developed. To conquer this field we must, I am
persuaded, make the concept of specifically mathematical proof itself
into an object of investigation, just as the astronomer considers the
movement of his position, the physicist studies the theory of his
apparatus, and the philosopher criticizes reason itself.</p>
<p><a href="#55" name="55">&#182;</a> To be sure, the execution of this
programme is at present still an unsolved task.</p>
<p><a href="#56" name="56">&#182;</a> In conclusion, I should like to sum up
in a few sentences my general conception of the essence of the
axiomatic method. I believe: anything at all that can be the object of
scientific thought becomes dependent on the axiomatic method, and
thereby indirectly on mathematics, as soon as it is ripe for the
for-mation of a theory. By pushing ahead to ever deeper layers of
axioms in the sense explained above we also win ever-deeper insights
into the essence of scien-tific thought itself, and we become ever
more conscious of the unity of our knowledge. In the sign of the
axiomatic method, mathematics is summoned to a leading role in
science.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="#from" name="from">From</a> Ewald's introduction to the
above, in <em>From Kant to Hilbert</em>, volume 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hilbert is persistently misconstrued as a 'formalist', i.e. as
somebody who was so shaken by the paradoxes that he took up the
theory that mathematics is merely a game played with meaningless
symbols. But the intellectual background to Hilbert's proof theory
was richer than this. To be sure, the paradoxes were an important
goad; but he had more positive ambitions than the mere avoidance of
paradox. (Hilbert, in fact, in his unpublished G&#246;ttingen lectures,
repeatedly indicated that in his opinion Zermelo's work had
successfully resolved the known paradoxes.) His study of the
axiomatic foundations of geometry had yielded a rich harvest of
mathematical results&#8212;non-Archimedean geometries, a new topological
characterization of the plane, new theorems on the nature of
continuity&#8212;and there was every reason to hope that the same powerful
tool would prove equally useful in the other branches of mathematics
and physics mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>"As for the term 'formalist', it is so misleading that it should be
abandoned altogether as a label for Hilbert's philosophy of
mathematics. On the face of it, 'formalism' is not a felicitous
description for the style of reasoning one finds in <em>Anschauliche
Geometrie&#8211;'Intuitive geometry' (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen 1932)</em>, a
work which was written at the high-point of Hilbert's work in proof
theory; nor does it accurately convey the convictions of the man
who, in his G&#246;ttingen lectures, derided those who saw mathematics as
a mere heaping-up of consequences mechanically derived from a given
stock of axioms; nor the man who ended his essay, 'On the infinite',
by saying, 'We gain a conviction that runs counter to the earlier
endeavours of Frege and Dedekind, the conviction that, if scientific
knowledge is to be possible, certain intuitive conceptions
[Vorstellungen] and insights are indispensable; logic alone does not
suffice' (<em>Hilbert 1926</em>). As the present selection makes clear,
Hilbert viewed formal axiom systems instrumentally, as a powerful
tool for mathematical research, a tool to be employed when a field
had reached a point of sufficient ripeness. But he nowhere suggests
that the whole of mathematics can simply be <em>identified</em> with the
study of formal systems; and indeed in his proof-theoretical
writings he took considerable pains to point out that the genuine
mathematics&#8211;<em>inhaltliche Mathematik</em>&#8211;takes place, not in the
formalism, but in the meta-language. For all these reasons, Hilbert
himself rejected the label 'formalist' (see, for example, <em>Hilbert
1931a</em>, &#167;35), and students of his thought would do well to follow
his example."</p>

<title>The Book of Why, by Pearl and Mackenzie</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>In <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/">The Book of Why</a>, Judea Pearl explains that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_Pearl">Judea Pearl</a>'s
work is very important and most statisticians are malicious, fools, or
both. The attempt to popularize his work fails to usefully communicate
his contributions. You're better off reading his <a href="https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r481.pdf">Seven Tools</a>
paper, which in six pages is more complete than and as instructive as
the book.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#useful">Possibly useful ideas</a></li>
<li><a href="#no_causality">Sidestepping causality</a></li>
<li><a href="#no_ai">Wishful AI</a></li>
<li><a href="#impediments">Difficulties in reading</a></li>
<li><a href="#quotes">Selected quotes</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="useful"></a>Possibly useful ideas</h3>
<p>The book is about how to answer questions based on data, which is a
topic I'm very interested in. I tried to <a href="/20200912-what_should_be_in_your_regression/">summarize</a> some of the
simplest ideas conveyed, about what variables to control for when
estimating an effect. The book isn't a textbook, but I wish it had
better explained how to implement more sophisticated control
techniques.</p>
<p>Pearl references a <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/aglynn/files/glynnkashin-frontdoor.pdf">paper</a> whose authors used paired observational
and experimental data, finding that "front-door adjustment" with the
observational data gives a result like that from the experimental
data. That's compelling! How can I use that adjustment?</p>
<p>I also liked the material (starting pages 200 and 309) on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox">Simpson's Paradox</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, I think the book is trying to offer some useful ideas. I
wish it were more successful in conveying them.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="no_causality"></a>Sidestepping causality</h3>
<p>You might think this book is about determining whether something
causes something else, based on data. It is <a href="#hill_guidelines">not</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... causal questions can never be answered from data alone." (page
351)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite Pearl's finality, there is research on doing just this. It
goes by <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/task/causal-discovery">causal discovery</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_causal_analysis">exploratory causal analysis</a>. In
<a href="http://www.chalearn.org/challenges.html">experiments</a>, some machine learning <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/guyon_isabelle_causality_challenge_final_short_r02.pdf">methods</a> do much better than
chance in identifying known causal relationships. Pearl even advised a
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2312">related paper</a>. I agree there are epistemological uncertainties in
this field, but it's interesting!</p>
<p>The closest the book comes to model identification are some allusions
to independence tests that can indicate data isn't consistent with a
model (or "Fit Indices" in <a href="https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r481.pdf">Seven Tools</a>). Pearl's causal models
come from the outside knowledge of humans.</p>
<p>The book also doesn't have much to say on the philosophy of causation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... I have not attempted to define causation anywhere in this book
..." (page 48)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That isn't quite true, because he does eventually discuss
counterfactual definitions of causality. But for the most part,
causation is given an axiomatic existence and becomes a silent arrow.
<a href="https://youtu.be/36GT2zI8lVA">Feynman</a> is more fun.</p>
<p>The arrows aren't necessarily bad, but the book is so
<a href="#impediments">busy</a> begging for unrelated praise that we don't get a
clear picture of what they're good for.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="no_ai"></a>Wishful AI</h3>
<p>Distinctions between statistics, machine learning, and AI can be
murky, but this book has a mostly statistical flavor. Given a causal
model and data, it's possible to estimate (learn) parameters and make
predictions.</p>
<p>As <a href="#no_causality">above</a>, there's no developed mechanism to learn
what the causal graph should be. Systems like
<a href="https://automaticstatistician.com/">The Automatic Statistician</a> do more to discover relationships in
data. Pearl's methods require a human to provide a causal graph.</p>
<p>I quite agree with Pearl that current AI seems too <a href="/20170429-from_behaviorist_to_constructivist_ai/">behaviorist</a>.
Mental models seem important to intelligence. His approach of defining
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence">symbolic</a> solution to a class of problems he likes is not a
compelling solution.</p>
<p>Like the proposal of Gary Marcus in The Algebraic Mind, Pearl
<a href="#brain">offers</a> that the symbolic system of his design "must be close
to the way that our brains represent" things (page 269). This is not
clear to me.</p>
<p>I agree that more advanced AI should be able to understand causality.
I'm not sure Pearl's explicit methods will play a part. I further
disagree with him on how <a href="#conversation">communication</a> works, and the
<a href="#chinese_room">Chinese Room</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="impediments"></a>Difficulties in reading</h3>
<p>I have to imagine that Pearl is likable in person, but his style here
reads as extreme self-praise and even putting down others to seem
better by comparison. Knowing him only through this book, it's hard to
root for him.</p>
<p>He tilts at straw men, writing as if <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/376920/the-book-of-why-by-judea-pearl-why-is-he-bashing-statistics">statisticians</a> and economists
have never thought about causality without his guidance. But
researchers have <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/141324NCJRS.pdf">not</a> been afraid to say things are "most likely a
cause, not just a correlate" even without his work.</p>
<p>To make his work seem more novel, he keeps it at a distance from
<a href="#coefficients">familiar</a> topics, even when only the interpretation is
different, preventing readers from easily connecting with prior
knowledge.</p>
<p>He writes as if he could have more quickly shown a connection between
smoking and lung cancer, but does not support this with evidence or
example of a feasible mechanism. You might disagree with Tufte about
whether data visualization could have prevented the Challenger
disaster, but at least Tufte <a href="https://blogs.stockton.edu/hist4690/files/2012/06/Edward-Tufte-Visual-and-Statistical-Thinking.pdf">shows</a> you the visualization.</p>
<p>In <a href="#interaction1">multiple</a> <a href="#interaction2">places</a>, Pearl says
linear models don't support interactions. There must be an
interpretation of this that is true, but I don't know what it is.
Interactions are commonly modeled with linear models.</p>
<p>I had hoped that with some effort I'd be able to follow the example on
page 83, but as far as I can tell it is incomplete or incorrect. (I
emailed the authors asking for clarification and will update as
appropriate.)</p>
<p>Andrew Gelman's <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/01/08/book-pearl-mackenzie/">notes</a> mention some issues with the book. (And some
others are even more <a href="#asylum">glaring</a>.) But also: Sherlock Holmes is
not known for deduction or induction, but for abduction (page 93).
It's not clear why we should change multiple variables on page 279,
but freeze them on page 312.</p>
<p>This book could have been so much better.</p>
