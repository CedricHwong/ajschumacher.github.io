<p>Often, when I check the news, I don't really want news. I just want to
stop looking at whatever I was looking at. Just for a second. But the
news is distracting. So I made a <a href="relax.html">redirect</a> that goes to a random
nice picture. It's available at <a href="https://bit.ly/relaxing-news">bit.ly/relaxing-news</a>. Enjoy!</p>

<title>Take notes like Paul Halmos</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Halmos">Paul Halmos</a> recommended taking minimalist notes and then later
expanding the notes from memory. This lets you pay more attention in
the moment and then exercise your recall afterward, which is good for
memory. Paired with speech-to-text transcription, you can also avoid
the risk of missing anything.</p>
<p>Here's how Halmos explained note-taking in his automathography:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Lecture courses are a standard way of learning something&#8211;one of the
worst ways. Too passive, that's the trouble. Standard
recommendation: take notes. Counter argument: yes, to be sure,
taking notes is an activity, and if you do it, you have something
solid to refer back to afterward, but you are likely to miss the
delicate details of the presentation as well as the big picture, the
Gestalt&#8211;you are too busy scribbling to pay attention. Counter
counter-argument: if you don't take notes, you won't remember what
happened, in what order it came, and, chances are, your attention
will flag part of the time, you'll daydream, and, who knows, you
might even nod off.</p>
<p>"It's all true, the arguments both for and against taking notes. My
own solution is a compromise: I take very skimpy notes, and then,
whenever possible, I transcribe them, in much greater detail, as
soon afterward as possible. By very skimpy notes I mean something
like one or two words a minute, plus, possibly a crucial formula or
two and a crucial picture or two&#8211;just enough to fix the order of
events, and, incidentally, to keep me awake and on my toes. By
transcribe I mean in enough detail to show a friend who wasn't
there, with some hope that he'll understand what he missed." (Paul
Halmos, "I want to be a mathematician")</p>

<title>Cattell didn't say we process words faster than pictures</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McKeen_Cattell">James Cattell</a> wrote: "experiments I have made show that we can
recognise a single colour or picture in a slightly shorter time than a
word or letter, but take longer to name it."</p>
<p><img alt="diagram of reading vs. seeing an image" src="diagram.jpg"></p>
<p>This is consistent with words being distinct from the concepts they
represent.</p>
<hr>
<p>Reading the excellent
<a href="https://www.northernpublicradio.org/post/how-flawed-idea-teaching-millions-kids-be-poor-readers">How a flawed idea is teaching millions of kids to be poor readers</a>,
I was struck by this interesting claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you're a skilled reader, your brain has gotten so good at
reading words that you process the word "chair" faster than you
process a picture of a chair."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sentence points to footnote 34:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This was established in the late 19th century by a researcher named
James Cattell who compared reaction times to words and images using
a newly developed timing mechanism that could measure reactions to
within 1/1,000th of a second. See <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Essentials+of+Assessing%2C+Preventing%2C+and+Overcoming+Reading+Difficulties+-p-9781118845240">this book</a>, p. 30."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That book is
<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/-p-9781118845240">Essentials of Assessing, Preventing, and Overcoming Reading Difficulties</a>,
and the relevant paragraph on page 30 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"James Cattell published a paper in 1886 demonstrating a newly
developed timing mechanism that could measure reaction times to
within 1 millisecond (i.e., 1/1,000th of a second). With this level
of precision, he discovered that the reaction times for reading
printed words like <em>chair</em> or <em>tree</em> were faster than reaction times
for naming a chair or a tree when shown a picture of those items.
Thus, over 125 years ago, there was evidence that naming objects and
naming written words were not the same skills, contrary to our
intuitions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That 1886 paper is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mind/article-abstract/os-XI/41/63/2888375">The Time it Takes to See and Name Objects</a>. The
paper is under three pages long. It doesn't convince me that Cattell
had millisecond precision in his measurements, and it's not
principally about comparing words and images. There's one relevant
paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The time required to see and name colours and pictures of objects
was determined in the same way. The time was found to be about the
same (over &#189;sec.) for colours as for pictures, and about twice as
long as for words and letters. Other experiments I have made show
that we can recognise a single colour or picture in a slightly
shorter time than a word or letter, but take longer to name it. This
is because in the case of words and letters the association between
the idea and name has taken place so often that the process has
become automatic, whereas in the case of colours and pictures we
must by a voluntary effort choose the name. Such experiments would
be useful in investigating aphasia."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It isn't explained in the paper, but I have to imagine he measured
recognition as distinct from naming via some mechanism like tapping
when you see a picture of a tree, for example.</p>
<p>So the consistency of the quotes above with the Cattell source depends
on what it means "to process." If it means "to name," then it's
consistent. But if it means "to recognize," which I think is more
natural, then it doesn't convey the result Cattell published.</p>
<p>I think this is all fascinating; I'd love to learn about more recent
research on this topic.</p>

<title>The Economics of Star Trek, by Webb</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I read the print version of the <a href="https://medium.com/@RickWebb/the-economics-of-star-trek-29bab88d50">blog post</a>, which delivers on the
fun of thinking about a world with the economics of the Star Trek
future. In the end you can't expect scifi to deliver economic
salvation, but imaginative inspiration is a fine starting point for
learning and thinking more.</p>
<p>I didn't really find Webb's guesses to constitute a workable system,
though I can't really say whether the problem is his, Star Trek's, or
the failure of my imagination.</p>
<p>There's also an even more serious book on this topic: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekonomics">Trekonomics</a>,
by Manu Saadia.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you don't believe that nothing is forever, if you don't believe
that society and humans can change, then you do not believe in the
future (and, incidentally, you do not believe in the past either)."
(page 11, in Manu Saadia's Foreward)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The one thing the show gets right is violence.</p>
<p>"I would point to a recent book by Stanford historian Walter
Scheidel: <em>The Great Leveler: Violence and The History of Inequality
from the Stone Age to the Twenty First Century</em> (Princeton
University Press, 2017). Professor Scheidel's thesis is that
throughout human history, only violence and war have truly managed
to solve economic conflicts&#8211;and even more so when economic
inequality got out of control, whether in pre-modern agrarian
societies or during the turbulent and genocidal last century.
Western Europe's prosperity rose out of the ashes and gas chambers
of World War II. The war annihilated the old social hierarchies on
the Continent, capitalists who happily collaborated with the Nazis
were cast out of society and expropriated, thus removing the main
opposition to expansive social safety net and to the modern welfare
state. Former enemies began to cooperate and to coordinate, first
economically and later politically. The European Union grew out of
the War, it was a project borne out of the resistance to Nazism. The
same is true of the post-war economic order (mostly, the
Bretton-Woods accords shepherded by John Maynard Keynes) and of the
United Nations. It is important to remember that all these were
noble yet practical projects, conceived and imagined by idealists
while the war was raging on and its outcome was still very much in
the balance. If anything this proves that there is value in
imagination and idealism, especially in times of great upheaval. One
must always be ready." (pages 12-13, in Manu Saadia's Foreward)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a strange mix of dark and light...</p>
<p>(In Star Trek, many advances happened following
<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Eugenics_Wars">The Eugenics Wars of the 1990s</a>.)</p>
<p>Webb also opines on page 141 that "the sense lingers that if we <em>are</em>
to arrive at a Trek vision of the future, we might have to go through
our own version of The Eugenics Wars to get there."</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Federation seems a bit like Williamsburg&#8211;a lot of artists who
don't need to work." (page 41)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Interesting bit on page 90 about a UBI study showing it increased
divorce rates (which people took as a bad thing, I think) but then
later it turned out the divorce result was a statistical error.</p>
<hr>
<p>John Kenneth Galbraith's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Affluent_Society">The Affluent Society</a> is referenced on
pages 134-135 as a text whose "arguments can be said to underpin [the]
Trek ideal."</p>
<p>Page 135 also references Fred Hirsch's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hirsch#Limits_to_Growth">Social Limits to Growth</a>.</p>
<p>Page 141 references
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventing_the_Future:_Postcapitalism_and_a_World_Without_Work">Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work</a> and

<title>Game Changer, by Solomon and Blumberg</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I picked this up because of the subtitle, "How to be 10x in the talent
economy." I'm interested in human <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/issues/174">differences in productivity</a>. The
<a href="https://www.harpercollinsleadership.com/game-changer/">book</a> had little to say on the technical side, but emphasized
balancing "hard" and "soft" skills, with a big focus on continual
improvement via feedback and coaching. The book is largely an
advertisement for the authors' businesses (10x <a href="https://www.10xmanagement.com/">management</a> /
<a href="https://10xascend.com/">ascend</a>) and I think fairly effective as such.</p>
<p>I've worked in a couple companies with variations on the theme of
having a "career manager" and a "project manager," sometimes the same
person, which can engender conflicts of interest. Solomon and
Blumberg's talent management model essentially outsources your career
management to an independent firm, which is interesting. It could be
viewed as a kind of <a href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/matrix-organization-structure-reason-evolution-1837">matrixing</a> that extends beyond company borders.</p>
<p>Another way of viewing it is as starting your own consultancy but
outsourcing lead generation (and some other functions, like contracts)
to Solomon and Blumberg. That removes a major difficulty of going it
alone, if it works well. There are still trade-offs associated with
working 1099 vs. W-2 jobs; better health insurance options etc. would
still help more people make the leap toward greater independence from
corporations.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>The authors give a quantitative example early on to make "10x" real:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Two weeks later, Nicole returned to our office with the news that
she had let go of no less than thirty-three of her thirty-six-person
team. <em>More than 90 percent.</em> She was sorry to lay off that many
fine workers and was quick to mention that they were well taken care
of, but there was no way around this one simple fact: Our three
recommended 10xers could deliver a better, stronger, more
sustainable product than thirty-three or even a hundred engineers
who were just "very good."" (page xiv)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's some interesting conversation to be had about labor relations,
the future of work, and what direction we really want to move in, I
think.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the new talent economy, everybody you deal with better be 10x,
or at least striving to be." (page xiv)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Great talent becomes 10x when it develops the quality of
<em>manageability</em>&#8211;the ability to seek out and internalize powerful
outside guidance, built on an insatiable desire for growth and
improvement." (page xx)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... they do it because <em>they love the doing of it</em>&#8211;it's the most
important thing you can know about 10xers." (page 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... the future will see work and learning blend into one." (page
14, quoting <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2019/01/02/solving-future-skills-challenges/">The Key To Solving Future Skills Challenges</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 16 they reference
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/24/the-two-pizza-rule-and-the-secret-of-amazons-success">The two-pizza rule and the secret of Amazon's success</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>They speak positively about Objectives and Key Results (<a href="https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/">OKRs</a>)...
Maybe I should try those?</p>
<hr>
<p>They have a neat <a href="https://10xascend.com/calculator/">Lifestyle Calculator</a> for considering 24 different
priorities in considering a job.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"When you see a door, what do you do? Do you break it down, kick it
open? Or do you go under it, over it? I need people who consider
every possibility, who can't just look at a thing for what it
usually is. They find strategic solutions from every angle. If you
can't do that, then you're the kind of person that gets stuck, and I
don't have time to help you when you do." (page 34, quoting Jesse
Lee)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Addiction, self-sabotage, procrastination, laziness, rage, chronic
fatigue, and depression are all ways that we withhold our full
participation in the program of life that we are offered." (page 43,
quoting Charles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Eisenstein#The_More_Beautiful_World_Our_Hearts_Know_is_Possible">Eisenstein</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Chapter 3, "Success and Sabotage&#8211;The Manageability Continuum," is
largely about growth via feedback, and hiring for people who can do
that.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The cost of a bad hire is incalculable, and not just from a
financial perspective." (page 57)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""I don't think you can fix a temper. For the bottom 10 percent,
sabotage is just so ingrained in their personality. And I'm not a
big fan of performance improvement plans. Ninety-five percent of the
time, they're not going to make it, and if they do make it, you're
just excusing the fact that they're not really the right person for
the job because you don't want HR to be upset. It's very unusual for
someone from that lower 10 percent or 15 percent to suddenly become
a top 10 percent. At best you can move them into the middle group
where they can contribute without getting in the way."</p>
<p>"Goldsmith is far more optimistic about the 80 percent in the
middle, those with mixed impulses. "<em>They</em> can change. I've seen
examples when great leaders have been put in place that inspire
previously unsuccessful teams and individuals."" (pages 58-59,
quoting Scott Goldsmith)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""The biggest change was...the leader worked hard to help the
individuals on that team to <em>change their mindset.</em>"" (page 59,
quoting Scott Goldsmith)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""I ask potential new hires one question: <em>'On a scale of one to
ten, how weird are you?'</em> And I never hire lower than a seven.""
(page 59, quoting Scott Goldsmith)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On pages 62-63, they highlight three interview questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How well did the potential 10xer handle a significant mistake of
   their own making?</li>
<li>How does the potential 10xer handle a situation where a boss or
   client wants something he or she thinks is a bad idea?</li>
<li>What does the potential 10xer identify as their biggest
   professional weaknesses?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>On page 70 they talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window">Johari window</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""In fact, I believe that in the future we're going to look back and
say that what we did before genetic engineering was barbaric and
like playing a genetic lottery on our children."" (page 125, quoting
Bryan Bishop)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book doesn't say much of anything about genetic contributions to
being "10x" and this quote isn't intended to be related to that topic,
but the concept is sort of uncomfortably in the background somehow...</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... once you lose the talent war, you completely limit a company's
ability to compete and excel." (page 140)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"After all, the difference between management and leadership is
huge." (page 142)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am humbly and strongly requesting your feedback. We have a lot of
contact on an ongoing basis and I am really focused on learning more
about my weaknesses, blind spots, or other areas that need
meaningful improvement." (page 164)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Part of some recommended language for soliciting feedback.)</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>""Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no
one else can see."" (page 187, quoting Arthur Schopenhauer)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 200, they talk about what they call a "L.E.A.P. doc" which is
an employment List of Expectations and Priorities, which they suggest
sending as a kind of first move in negotiating employment. An
interesting idea.</p>

<title>How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, by Bennett</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I've recommended this 1908 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Live_on_24_Hours_a_Day">book</a> since <a href="/2010/07/31/thoughts-on-tinkering-toward-utopia/">2010</a>/<a href="/20160320-books_for_professionals/">2011</a>, and I
thought I'd revisit it. The sexist language makes it hard to continue
recommending; I'd love to see a modern version.</p>
<p>The main message I take from this reading is the need to slow down,
when trying to do more. Reflect. Think. It's not packing as much as
possible into the time you have, it's getting as much as you can out.
As with eating, the good life isn't just quantity per time.</p>
<p>I relate aspects of this book to more recent <a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/">ideas</a> about
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">learning</a> and memory, which I also think are good. Many of the
charming aspects of the book relate to the <em>why</em> more than the <em>how</em>
of learning, and try to encourage the reader to believe that they
<em>can</em> find the time to do more. (A modern version might reference
statistics on <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/people-are-spending-most-of-their-waking-hours-staring-at-screens-2018-08-01">screen-watching</a>, and find that people have a lot of
time that might be better spent.)</p>
<p>Taken mildly, Bennett's advice is to get a hobby, to develop an
interest, aligned with "cultivation of the mind." Taken more
seriously, he encourages more purposeful, joyful, and "examined" life.
I can get behind both sentiments.</p>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.jpg"></p>

<title>The Variance Sum Law is Interesting</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The <a href="http://onlinestatbook.com/2/glossary/variance_sum_law.html">Variance Sum Law</a> is simple enough that it's often given
without explanation, but I think it's interesting enough that it
deserves a little thought.</p>
<p>The Variance Sum Law says that for two independent random variables
\( A \) and \( B \) with variances \( \sigma_A^2 \) and \(
\sigma_B^2 \), the sum \( A+B \) has variance \( \sigma_{A+B}^2 =
\sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2 \).</p>
<p>Explaining an application of this, you might consider an example: say
\( a = 10 \) and \( b = 3 \).</p>
<p>This kind of example is used in at least one course to introduce
<a href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/2/2.5">analysis of variance</a>. After introducing the \( 13 = 10 + 3 \)
part, they continue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Although the derivation isn't as simple as it seems, the
decomposition holds for the sum of the squared distances, too."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's possible to find a <a href="http://web.pdx.edu/~joel8/resources/ConceptualPresentationResources/VarianceSumLaw.pdf">derivation</a>, but they're generally not very
satisfying. And you know that the sum of squares is not the same as
the square of the sum: \( 13^2 \neq 10^2 + 3^2 \) because \( 169
\neq 109\). So what's going on?</p>
<p>Using a single example helps explain what one element of data looks
like, but a single example doesn't have a variance.</p>
<p>We can make the example just slightly more complete to show how
variances add.</p>
<p>Say \( A \) is \( +10 \) half the time and \( -10 \) half the
time, while \( B \) is equally likely to be \( +3 \) or \( -3
\). So \( \sigma_A^2 = 100 \) and \( \sigma_B^2 = 9 \).</p>
<p>All our squares will be positive, so we can ignore negative outcomes
by symmetry here.</p>
<p>With that simplification, notice \( A + B \) is equally likely to be
\( 10 - 3 = 7 \) or \( 10 + 3 = 13 \).</p>
<p>\[ \frac{(10-3)^2 + (10-3)^2}{2} = \frac{7^2 + 13^2}{2} = \frac{49 + 169}{2} = \frac{218}{2} = 109 = 100 + 9 = 10^2 + 3^2 \]</p>
<p>The addition and subtraction cancel out after squaring so that the
variances add.</p>
<p>This property, that \( (a+b)^2 + (a-b)^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2)\), is what
makes variance decomposition work, for uncorrelated components.</p>
<p>It's simple algebra, but it's still kind of neat. Here's a geometric
illustration:</p>
<p><img alt="geometric illustration" src="geometric_illustration.jpg"></p>
<p>\[ (a-b)^2 + (a+b)^2 = b^2 + a^2 + a^2 + b^2 \]</p>
<p>Maybe this is completely intuitive for some people, but for me this
balancing of increased and decreased squares is something of a
pleasant surprise. Stop and smell the mathematical roses, you know?</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/420387/122282">also</a> a Pythagorean connection, which I think is neat, but
I haven't so far gotten it lined up with my intuition.</p>

<title>Failure to Disrupt, by Reich</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>As is especially salient during a pandemic, "technology alone can't
transform education." Reich's <a href="https://failuretodisrupt.com/">book</a> nicely wraps up the most recent
edtech hype cycle, which I was more optimistic about <a href="/2011/09/10/future-of-education/">at the time</a>. Reich thinks we have to keep <a href="/2010/07/31/thoughts-on-tinkering-toward-utopia/">tinkering toward utopia</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kinds of edtech "learning at scale"<ul>
<li><a href="#chapter1">MOOCs</a> (instructor-guided)</li>
<li><a href="#chapter2">adaptive tutors</a> (algorithm-guided)</li>
<li><a href="#chapter3">open world</a> (self/peer-guided)</li>
<li><a href="#chapter4">games</a> (aspects mostly of adaptive and open)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Challenges<ul>
<li><a href="#chapter5">difficult to get adoption</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter6">mostly helps those who least need help</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter7">complex tasks defy simple assessments</a></li>
<li><a href="#chapter8">data/experiments risks/benefits</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I mostly agree with Reich, except that now I tend to put more weight
on knowledge &#224; la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._D._Hirsch">Hirsch</a>, and I still have hope for the
application of tools like <a href="/20201009-anki_is_easy/">Anki</a> in educational settings.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="cover" src="cover.png"></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter1"></a>Chapter 1: Instructor-Guided Learning at Scale: Massive Open Online Courses</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"To a first approximation, there are only two primary approaches to
teaching and learning. As Plutarch wrote in "On Listening" in the
first century CE, "Education is not the filling of a pail, but the
lighting of a fire."" (page 22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reich then identifies "instructionism" and "social constructivism" as
names for these approaches, associated with Edward L. Thorndike and
John Dewey, respectively.</p>
<p>One thing I thought I noticed in edtech over the years was a trend in
which companies that focused on algorithms (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knewton">Knewton</a>) moved
toward being more like content companies over time. In a sense they
started as pail companies, but found people wouldn't buy empty pails.
Might be related to the <a href="#chapter5">adoption problem</a>.</p>
<p>This is a fun metaphor to play with. I think it might be better as
"not the stacking of wood, but the lighting of a fire." When a fire is
burning, you want to keep getting more wood. The wood is largely the
same in both approaches; the difference is the motivation or
application around it.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... teaching how to reason from evidence is one of the main
purposes of higher education, ..." (page 27)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"People develop self-regulated learning strategies through direct
instruction and practice, often through a long apprenticeship in
formal educational systems." (page 36)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have jokingly summarized the bulk of MOOC learning research as
proving Reich's Law: "People who do stuff do more stuff, and people
who do stuff do better than people who don't do stuff."" (page 39)</p>

<p>This is a slight contradiction to the above in that it says some stuff
is better than other stuff, but still a nice reference:</p>

do online and very little understanding of what changes inside their
heads." (page 39)</p>

soon after enrollment, we start our courses with short "capsule"

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... a feature of logistic curves is that when plotted against
log-transformed <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axes, the S-curve becomes a linear
straight line." (page 60)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't seem true. Maybe it means that with a log y axis, the
left and right sides are each approximately linear? I <a href="https://twitter.com/planarrowspace/status/1311371349957505030">tweeted</a> at
Reich about this.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Reading instructors sometimes discuss a transition, which happens
in about the third grade, from learning to read&#8211;learning how to
decode the sounds and meaning of text&#8211;to reading to learn&#8211;using
reading to advance content knowledge." (pages 63-64)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ritter's research team looked at how much adaptive mastery learning
teachers actually allowed in their classes, and they found that some
teachers assigned work in Carnegie Learning in such a way that it
wasn't really personalized&#8211;these teachers required students to work
on problem sets related to the topics being taught at that moment to
the whole class. By contrast, other teachers allowed students to
work at their own pace, even if this meant that some students were
still doing practice problems on topics that might have been covered
in class weeks earlier. Ritter's team found that overall learning
gains were higher in the classes where students were allowed more
opportunities to move at their own pace; in other words, the
teachers who used Carnegie Learning as intended had more learning
gains in their classrooms than did the teachers who kept their
students moving in lockstep." (page 70)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Makes me think about whole-group single track, tracking, personalized
via computer, tutoring, and how these are thought about in different
ways...</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter3"></a>Chapter 3: Peer-Guided Learning at Scale: Networked Learning Communities</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The consensus about the great potential of personalized learning
depended on a stark disagreement about what the term actually
meant." (page 77)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roughly, this is referring to personalizing <em>pace</em> (go through the
same material but at whatever speed you like) versus personalizing
<em>content</em> (choose your own area of interest, pursue it however you
want).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... a shift in identity where the learning activity is a part of
who they are rather than something that they do ..." (page 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 95, a reference to
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1">Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The advantage of guidance begins to recede only when learners have
sufficiently high prior knowledge to provide &#8220;internal&#8221; guidance."
(from the abstract)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Put simply, people have a limited working memory, and when learners
allocate that working memory to solving a problem, they often are
not permanently encoding learning about the patterns and practices
that let them solve that type of problem." (page 95)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Reich raises the issue of people choosing to get involved in bad stuff
like hate groups. So total freedom in what to get into isn't
necessarily great.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Somehow, millions of people around the world find ways to teach and
learn with one another online without any formal training and
sometimes without any organization, and yet when designers try to
create these kinds of environments with intention, they encounter
substantial challenges with motivation and comprehension." (page
102)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is he deliberately avoiding the obvious interpretation from
selection/observation bias? In a whole world, some people have
motivation and comprehension to do great things. If you have a fixed
group of students that isn't skimming those people, many won't. It
seems highly likely that peer-guided learning at scale has the same
issue as other MOOCs, in that the people who benefit are
overwhelmingly people who are already doing really well to begin with.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thinking about the various ways to do whole class together vs. totally
personalized/independent learning... When I was teaching,
"differentiation" was the popular term for customizing class
activities for students who were struggling or way ahead...</p>
<p>I think really, there's some stuff that we want all students to learn,
and there are learning experiences that make sense to do with a whole
class: stuff about working in groups, communication, etc. It would be
neat to have more explicit separation between a small whole-group set
of content, and scaffolding for students to study more things on their
own.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter4"></a>Chapter 4: Testing the Genres of Learning at Scale: Learning Games</h3>
<hr>
<p>The difficulty of <em>transfer</em> (mentioned page 109) makes me wonder to
what extent transfer is related to general intelligence - or whether
they might even be largely the same thing.</p>
<p>The referenced <em>Critical Thinking: Why Is It So Hard to Teach?</em>
(<a href="https://www.readingrockets.org/article/critical-thinking-why-it-so-hard-teach">web</a>, <a href="https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/Crit_Thinking.pdf">more complete PDF</a>) is quite good.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"A more pessimistic view built upon the research on transfer is that
people who spend a lot of time playing <em>Minecraft</em> will primarily
learn about playing <em>Minecraft</em>." (page 119)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But: some reasonable notes on, for example, the general strategy of
knowing to look things up online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Domain-independent skills are slightly useful in lots of different
domains but not deeply useful in any particular domain." (page 120)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"an <em>edtech Matthew effect</em> is quite common: that new technologies
disproportionately benefit learners with the financial, social, and
technical capital to take advantage of new innovations." (page 125)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Prw3xbk1Wo&amp;ab_channel=HippoCrit">Zoombinis</a> game seems kind of neat? Maybe mathier puzzles than
other puzzle games? Or not? Shrug?</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter5"></a>Chapter 5: The Curse of the Familiar</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The dilemma that Resnick and colleagues face as Scratch is widely
adopted in schools is that a variety of typical school structures
are inimical to the pedagogical philosophy behind Scratch." (page
134)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Reich is neglecting something that Scratch has in common with
most edtech, and which he comments on for other types: Learning with
Scratch depends hugely on the student being prepared for and/or having
characteristics that align with learning with Scratch.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Another approach from the Scratch team has been to develop decks of
physical coding cards ..." (page 138)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://nostarch.com/scratchcards3">Published</a> by No Starch.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... Getting Unstuck, a twenty-one-day email-based course during
which participants received daily creative challenges, ..." (page

<blockquote>
<p>"Education technology is a good field for those who see themselves
as patient optimists." (page 147)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter6"></a>Chapter 6: The Edtech Matthew Effect</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom argues that technologists often
imagine their students as "roaming autodidacts," which she describes
as "a self-motivated, able learner that is simultaneously embedded
in technocratic futures <em>and</em> disembedded from place, culture,
history, and markets."" (page 159)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter7"></a>Chapter 7: The Trap of Routine Assessment</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Autograders excel at assessing routine tasks. These are exactly the
kinds of tasks that we no longer need humans to do." (page 171)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incomplete. There are lots of basic things that humans need to
be able to do that can be assessed automatically. But I agree that
higher-level skills are difficult to assess automatically.</p>
<hr>
<p>Reich makes an example of a plumber who installs a water heater with
an LED panel and then says on page 175: "What would it be like to
explain to the young men in that apprenticeship program that fifty
years later, plumbers would be computer programmers?" This isn't the
case. The plumber who in fact installed his water heater didn't do any
programming. This was a bad example for the point I think Reich hoped
to make.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... the "reification fallacy," when we uncritically believe that
something's name accurately represents what that thing actually is."
(page 176)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somewhat unusual way of explaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)">this</a>. Interesting.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Computers can mostly assess what computers are good at doing, and
these are things we do not need humans to do in the labor market."
(page 197)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I already commented on this, but I'll comment again: I think he's
ignoring the many things that humans should be able to do that
computers can also do. I'm thinking mostly of simple recall, where
knowing something by heart (immediately) is way better than being able
to look it up (if you even know that it exists, to look up).</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="chapter8"></a>Chapter 8: The Toxic Power of Data and Experiments</h3>
<hr>
<p>Mostly, I think Reich is pulling punches in this chapter. He doesn't
go where I thought he was going to: He doesn't really address possible
abuses of student data or the negative effects that can arise
(intentionally or accidentally) from data and experiment.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If online learning leads to better outcomes from students, it will
be through the amalgamation of a thousand or ten thousand studies
like this one that incrementally accrete a knowledge base about
effective online learning." (page 223)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Reich takes his "tinkering" a little too far sometimes. If
what's really needed is a bigger leap, ten thousand incremental
experiments won't necessarily get there.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion: Preparing for the Next Learning-at-Scale Hype Cycle</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In 1913, Thomas Edision declared that the age of books was about to
give way to the age of motion pictures. He told an interviewer,
"Books will soon be obsolete in the public schools. Scholars will be
instructed through the eye. It is possible to teach every branch of
human knowledge with the motion picture. Our school system will be
completely changed inside of ten years." When Edison's ten-year
prediction failed to come to pass, he simple gave himself more time.
In 1923, speaking before the Federal Trade Commission, Edison
explained, "I made an experiment with a lot of [motion] pictures to
teach children chemistry. I got twelve children and asked them to
write down what they had learned, from the [motion] pictures. I was
amazed that such a complicated subject as chemistry was readily
grasped by them to a large extent through [motion] pictures. The
parts of the [motion] pictures they did not understand I did over
and over again until they finally understood the entire [motion]
picture. I think motion pictures have just started and it is my
opinion that in 20 years children will be taught through [motion]
pictures and not through textbooks."" (pages 229-230)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was worth reading the book just for these quotes, for this
video-hater.</p>
<p>Quote Investigator has the <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/02/15/books-obsolete/">receipts</a>, as usual. And you can read
the <a href="https://virginiachronicle.com/cgi-bin/virginia?a=d&amp;d=HR19230518.2.11">newspaper</a> for the second quote.</p>
<p>Reich mention's Khan's 2011 <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education">Let's Use Video to Reinvent Education</a> on page 231 as well.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The students who tend to thrive in these kinds of environments are
those who have already demonstrated academic proficiency, since most
people develop self-regulated learning through an apprenticeship in
the formal education system." (page 235)</p>

<title>Sampling can be hard to beat, for text understanding</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>If you have a lot of related documents (like thousands of reviews of a
product, or answers to a survey question) you might be tempted to use
an automatic procedure to summarize them (maybe making a word cloud,
or applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation">LDA</a>, or something fancier). No automated process is
flawless, but if you need to work with many groups of documents, such
an approach could be called for. Regardless of whether you use an
automated technique, you should still start by reading a sample of
documents, and in fact reading may be the best way to understand what
people have said.</p>
<p>This is a special case of a few more general principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the data</li>
<li>Simple techniques can be very effective</li>
<li>Start with a baseline for comparison</li>
</ul>

<title>The Point of Pointless Work, by Almossawi</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The title's not quite right, but there's some on that. <a href="https://almossawi.com/pointless-work/">It</a>'s mostly
Almossawi's personal adventures in publishing: the stories of
<a href="/20201012-bad_arguments_by_almossawi/">Bad Arguments</a> and <a href="/20201011-bad_choices_by_almossawi/">Bad Choices</a>. I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I liked the detail about publishing, including buying a pack of ten
ISBNs, and agonizing about getting pallets of books from a ship and
into Amazon fulfillment centers.</p>
<p>I also think he's right that it's good for people to do things not
just out of economic necessity, and we're fortunate when we're able to
do so.</p>

<h3>Selected quotes and commentary</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Anatol Rapoport has excellent advice about how to criticize. A
critic, he says, ought to begin by stating the other side's position
in a fair and objective way, then mentioning the areas of agreement,
and only then mentioning the areas of disagreement. The approach
does wonders when the goal is to turn something into a better
version of itself rather than to posture." (page 42)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also found more on this in a <a href="http://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/06/16/rapoport-rules-criticism/">post</a> based on a book by Dennett
which is in my to-read pile.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was surprised to find that the copyeditors were all freelancers.
... When [prior employee copyeditors] retired, the publisher
determined that it made economic and organizational sense to
outsource that responsibility to freelancers." (page 74)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet another example of trying to get work done by contractors rather
than employees.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/304164/problem-solving-101-by-ken-watanabe/">book</a> by a former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_%26_Company">McKinsey</a> consultant "started as a simple
guide to teach Japanese schoolchildren critical thinking skills." It's
a different perspective than the more math-focused
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It">How to Solve It</a>, for example, focusing on problems of everyday
life.</p>
<h3>Watanabe's steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>"understand the current situation"</li>
<li>"identify the root cause of the problem"</li>
<li>"develop an effective action plan"</li>
<li>"execute until the problem is solved, making modifications as necessary"</li>
</ol>
<h3>P&#243;lya's steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, you have to understand the problem.</li>
<li>After understanding, make a plan.</li>
<li>Carry out the plan.</li>
<li>Look back on your work. How could it be better?</li>
</ol>
<p>From these we learn that five steps is too many steps.</p>
<p>Watanabe emphasizes a number of visual aids:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Logic tree" - break something down into sub-groups, exhaustively</li>
<li>"Yes/no tree" - a logic tree with yes/no logic, drawn as a
   flowchart</li>
<li>"Problem-solving design plan" - columns for Issue, Hypothesis,
   Rationale, Analysis/Activities, Information Source (mostly about
   understanding the problem)</li>
<li>"Hypothesis pyramid" - Boxes with arrows to show (possible)
   contributing factors for a conclusion, both for plausible reasoning
   and for deductive reasoning as appropriate</li>
<li>"Pros and cons; Criteria and evaluation" - Tables with various
   structure for pros and cons</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple times he also uses quadrant charts where the axes are impact
and effort (for prioritizing). An interesting variation is that he has
his characters think about how to <em>change</em> the required effort by
asking friends for help, etc.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Selected quotes and (very rarely) comments</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Being a problem solver isn't just an ability; it's a whole
mind-set, one that drives people to bring out the best in themselves
and to shape the world in a positive way." (page ix)</p>

<title>Bad Arguments, by Almossawi</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I wondered if there was a book of fallacies, and it turned out there
were several. Almossawi's is the cutest by far, and it's
<a href="https://bookofbadarguments.com/">freely available</a> online.</p>
<p>Thinking about fallacies is a fun way to think about how we reason,
and how we conceptualize things. There's no one correct taxonomy of
fallacies, and fallacies aren't always bad arguments. Books like this
are good for starting to access some of these ideas.</p>
<hr>
<p>Almossawi has one of his distinctive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind map</a>s at the beginning of
the book. Linearized, the topics in the book look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical fallacies<ul>
<li>Formal<ul>
<li>Propositional<ul>
<li><strong>Affirming the consequent</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Informal<ul>
<li>Ambiguity<ul>
<li><strong>Equivocation</strong><ul>
<li>Redefinition<ul>
<li><strong>No true Scotsman</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Causal<ul>
<li><strong>Not a cause for a cause</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Slippery slope</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unwarranted assumption<ul>
<li><strong>False dilemma</strong></li>
<li><strong>Composition and division</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Begging the question<ul>
<li><strong>Circular reasoning</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weak analogy<ul>
<li>Unrepresentative sample<ul>
<li><strong>Hasty generalization</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Missing data<ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to ignorance</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Red herrings<ul>
<li><strong>Argument from consequences</strong></li>
<li><strong>Guilt by association</strong></li>
<li><strong>Straw man</strong></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to the bandwagon</strong></li>
<li>Emotional appeal<ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to fear</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Genetic fallacy</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to irrelevant authority</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ad hominem</strong></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to hypocrisy</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it's a good idea to organize ideas like this. It shows
clearly, for example, how many "different" fallacies are fundamentally
red herrings, according to the author. It also helps draw out that the
names of the fallacies aren't so important; in each case you could
just as well simply explain an argument's problem without using the
name.</p>
<p>It's fun to think about organizing these. Here's a different way I was
thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems with premises<ul>
<li><strong>Circular reasoning</strong> (A implies A is fine; the problem is
   starting with A.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arguing the wrong thing<ul>
<li>Ambiguity<ul>
<li><strong>Equivocation</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Redefinition<ul>
<li><strong>No true Scotsman</strong></li>
<li><strong>Straw man</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>False dilemma</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problems with form of argument (Non Sequitur)<ul>
<li><strong>Affirming the consequent</strong></li>
<li>Weak analogy<ul>
<li>Unrepresentative sample<ul>
<li><strong>Hasty generalization</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Missing data<ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to ignorance</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Causal<ul>
<li><strong>Not a cause for a cause</strong></li>
<li><strong>Slippery slope</strong> (This is sort of an odd one out; it's
   only a fallacy if it introduces some fallacious component,
   which could just as well be identified separately.
   [<a href="http://www.csun.edu/~dgw61315/fallacies.html#Slippery%20slope">discussion</a>])</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unwarranted assumption<ul>
<li><strong>Composition and division</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distractions from topic<ul>
<li><strong>Argument from consequences</strong></li>
<li><strong>Guilt by association</strong></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to the bandwagon</strong></li>
<li>Emotional appeal<ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to fear</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Genetic fallacy</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Appeal to irrelevant authority</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ad hominem</strong></li>
<li><strong>Appeal to hypocrisy</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think red herrings are generally non sequiturs, but they may not
necessarily be fallacies, in a probabilistic sense. Heck, even the
most "logical" fallacy (affirming the consequent) can still count as
evidence for a proposition.</p>
<p>Almossawi does also note on page 40 (ad hominem) "That said, there are
situations where one may legitimately question a person's credibility,
such as during trial testimony."</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are
the easiest person to fool. - Richard P. Feynman"</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On page 4, a reference to Gula's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nonsense-Herrings-Sacred-Everyday-Language/dp/1604191252/">Nonsense</a>, which might be a sort
of non-illustrated/longer version of Bad Arguments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That book reminded me of a list of guidelines that I had scribbled
down in a notebook a decade ago about how to argue; they were the
result of several years of arguing with strangers in online forums
and they included, for example, "Try not to make general claims
about things." That is obvious to me now, but to a schoolboy, it was
an exciting revelation." (page 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"One may reasonably appeal to <em>pertinent</em> authority, as scientists
and academics typically do. A vast majority of the things that we
believe in, such as atoms and the solar system, are on reliable
authority, as are all historical statements, to paraphrase C. S.
Lewis."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> "was a British writer and lay theologian" - is
Almossawi paraphrasing him on the appeal to authority as a joke? Not
that the claim is wrong, just that it's a funny place to cite an
unrelated figure.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Inductive argument: An <em>argument</em> in which if the <em>premisses</em> are
true, then it is probable that the conclusion will also be true."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what P&#243;lya calls plausible reasoning, maybe to avoid the
confusion with mathematical induction or the specific/general
explanation (which I reject) for deductive/inductive reasoning.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://www.livescience.com/21569-deduction-vs-induction.html">this</a> claim: "Inductive reasoning is the opposite of
deductive reasoning." is not particularly helpful. (This site is heavy
on the "deduction is general to specific, induction is specific to
general".)</p>
<p>This <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/#DedIndAbd">other</a> site has this example of induction: &#8220;John lives in
Chelsea&#8221; and &#8220;Most people living in Chelsea are rich&#8221; gives to &#8220;John
is rich.&#8221; This does not go from specific to general.</p>
<p>Plausible reasoning precedes logical reasoning (Almossawi quotes
Minsky: "Logic no more explains how we think than grammar explains how
we speak") and yet logical fallacies somewhat rudely direct us to
mistrust heuristics that are useful for plausible reasoning. This
relates to the idea of language being a model: the famous syllogism
takes "All men are mortal" as true, but really it's just highly
plausible. You really have to assume the premises.</p>
<p>In fact we could just as well speak of the Inductive Fallacy, and use
it to argue against all manner of things that are understood to be
true.</p>

<title>Bad Choices, by Almossawi</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I enjoyed Almossawi's illustrated introduction to computational
thinking, which is <a href="https://bookofbadchoices.com/">freely available</a> online. I've been <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/ajschumacher.github.io/issues/198">thinking</a>
about non-fiction(ish) books for kids, and this one could be read by
middle-schoolers, I think, and possibly spark interest in learning
more. It illustrates the challenges and rewards of telling stories
about computer science topics.</p>
<hr>
<p>Almossawi has one of his distinctive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind map</a>s toward the end of
the book. Linearized, the topics in the book look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals<ul>
<li>Stacks</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Linked lists</li>
<li>Asymptotic notation</li>
<li>Worst, average cases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Searching<ul>
<li>Binary search</li>
<li>Linear search</li>
<li>Hash tables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sorting<ul>
<li>Library sort</li>
<li>Priority queues</li>
<li>Mergesort</li>
<li>Quicksort</li>

<blockquote>
<p>"Note that all the lines in this book are plotted on a log-log
scale, which is why the shapes of the lines are the way they are."
(page xi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would have liked to see this better explained. The lines are never
labeled, and I'm not sure why this was intentional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The lines in those graphs were intentionally unlabeled." (page 137)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless it was for this reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In my experience, any learning environment that encourages students
to be fast learners is setting its students up for failure." (page
xi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's interesting, but I'm not sure it's a good justification. At
least, I think it would be good to be explicit, like: "Add your own
labels to these," if that's what the reader is supposed to do.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you look at human history, you're likely to find that many of
the names you recognize belong to people who were educated as
apprentices rather than as note takers." (page 3)</p>

<p>A glitch in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coding</a> example (starting page 69) is
corrected in the <a href="https://github.com/almossawi/badchoices/wiki/Errata">errata</a>.</p>

it.</p>

<title>Anki is easy</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)">Anki</a>, named after the Japanese for "memorization," is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> flashcard app. I've been interested in it
before, but I didn't jump in because it seemed like a commitment to
install it and be an Anki person. It turns out you don't need to
install anything, you can use <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">AnkiWeb</a> for free online, so I've
started adding cards and it's fun!</p>
<p>Now I keep an <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">AnkiWeb</a> tab open and add things I want to remember
as I come across them. A failure mode I experienced playing with
similar software in the past was adding pre-made decks of cards from
other people, which leads to frustration and just not caring about
them. Much better to add just occasional things that you care about.</p>
<p>Now instead of just complaining about my memory, I'm also doing
something about it!</p>

<title>Fusion isn't so hard</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I saw somebody <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/amp/news/2020/10/middle-school-student-achieved-nuclear-fusion-in-his-family-playroom-631163">post</a> about a kid achieving nuclear fusion at home,
and I was sure it was fake news. It referenced <a href="https://fusor.net/">fusor.net</a>, which
also looks fake. But the concept, at least, is real!
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor">WikiPedia</a>/<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/nuclear/fusion-on-a-budget">IEEE</a>) How cool! For a couple thousand dollars or
so, you can make a fusion reactor in your house, on a desk! I feel
like this should be more widely known.</p>
<p>You mostly hear about fusion in stars, which makes it seem... big. And
far away. Knowing you can do it as a hobbyist if you feel like makes
it seem so much more approachable! Together with the naturally
occurring fission <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/natures-nuclear-reactors-the-2-billion-year-old-natural-fission-reactors-in-gabon-western-africa/">reactors</a>, there are cool non-bomb, non-star
examples of both fission and fusion. Nice!</p>
<p>Also did you know you can buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium">deuterium</a>? I think you can probably
get it as a gas, but you can also just buy yourself some heavy water
if you want! It's just water, but with extra neutrons on the hydrogen!
How cool!</p>
<p>The good and bad of home fusion is that it's just a <em>little</em> bit of
fusion, and it takes a lot more energy to make it happen than you get
out. So it doesn't blow up, and the extra radioactivity won't kill you
very fast. As far as I can tell, these fusor devices are in a weird
zone of not being regulated, I think, because they're hard enough to
make and not quite dangerous enough to be a big risk.</p>
<p>I think it'd be a great thing to see more fusors in children's museums
(and other science museums). They don't have to turn it on; it'd just
be a cool exhibit to demonstrate that it's so possible.</p>

<title>Give the model epistemology</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Jaskie has a nice paper with
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9048765">A Modified Logistic Regression for Positive and Unlabeled Learning</a>.
I like that it extends the usual logistic function in a way that
captures the idea that labels may be incorrect. I wonder about
extending the idea to multi-class softmax, and its relationship with
label smoothing.</p>
<p>Here's the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic function</a>.</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ 1 }{ 1 + e^{-x} } \tag{1} \]</p>
<p>What Jaskie does is introduce another term in the denominator:</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ 1 }{ 1 + b^2 + e^{-x} } \tag{2} \]</p>
<p>The \( b \) term is squared to be non-negative, and learned during
model fitting. The effect is that the maximum score for a positive
example is less than one.</p>
<p>This makes sense in the positive unlabeled setting because Jaskie
differentiates between whether an example <em>is</em> positive and whether an
example is <em>labeled</em> positive. We only have the labels, and we know
that some positive examples may not be positively labeled, so the
probability based on the example that it is positively labeled is less
than one.</p>
<p>It's somewhat surprising that this seems to work quite well, as
demonstrated (for example) in Jaskie's Figure 6. (SLR is Standard
Logistic Regression, MLR is Jaskie's Modified Logistic Regression.)</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 6" src="figure_6.png"></p>
<p>Let's speculate about extending this idea to the multi-class setting.
First, just moving things around, Equation 2 becomes Equation 3.</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ e^x }{ (1 + b^2) e^x + 1 } \tag{3} \]</p>
<p>That form makes it easy to see the analogy between the usual logistic
function and the multi-class <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">softmax</a>. Then the natural thing to
suggest is Equation 4.</p>
<p>\[ \frac{ e^{x_i} }{ \sum (1 + b_i^2) e^{x_i} } \tag{4} \]</p>
<p>The semi-supervised setting in which there's a pile of unlabeled data
in addition to the labeled data is pretty common, especially when
labeling is expensive, and if something relatively simple like this
were to give similar performance benefits to Jaskie's binary case, it
could easily become very popular. (Assume you have a "garbage" class
as well, in the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/task/open-set-learning">open set</a> sense.)</p>
<p>There's probably a similar extension to keep the negative example
scores from going all the way to zero, if you think some of the true
negatives might have incorrectly positive labels (or otherwise wrong
labels in the multi-class setting).</p>
<p>I wonder about the relationship between these techniques and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02629">label smoothing</a>... With smoothed labels you still have fixed (or
at least sort of balanced) target probabilities, whereas the above
techniques allow learning where the targets should be... But I think
you wouldn't get the limits on logit growth, with the above
techniques... It would be neat if the above techniques gave you good
calibration <em>and</em> informative logits in the distillation sense. Hmm!</p>

<title>Drawbridge Up, by Enzensberger</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>This <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Drawbridge-Up-Mathematics-Cultural-Anathema/dp/156881156X">talk</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Magnus_Enzensberger">the author of The Number Devil</a> is unfortunately
hard to find at a reasonable price. It's a beautiful short version of
the not uncommon sentiment that math should be more widely
appreciated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Short: Drawbridge Up, by Enzensberger</li>
<li>Medium: <a href="/20200909-mathematicians_lament_by_lockhart/">A Mathematician's Lament, by Lockhart</a></li>
<li>Long: <a href="//20200925-how_not_to_be_wrong_by_ellenberg/">How Not to Be Wrong, by Ellenberg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mumford">Mumford</a>'s preface is <a href="https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/beyond/education.html">available</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am accustomed, as a professional mathematician, to living in a
sort of vacuum, surrounded by people who, as in the first paragraph
of Enzensberger's essay, declare with an odd sort of pride that they
are mathematically illiterate. How astonishing to come to the
International Congress and find a distinguished poet and essayist
who analyzes this problem with such a deep understanding and
sensitivity. This is a beautiful essay and great delight for a
mathematician to read. Here the strange contradictions with which we
live are laid bare with accuracy of a dissecting microscope. He is
onto our schizophrenic world in which, with one hand, we take pride
in building an elegant world utterly divorced from the demands of
reality and, with the other, claim that our ideas underlie virtually
all technological developments of significance. I was particularly
pleased to find that he believes progress is possible in teaching
mathematics, that it can be made exciting to young minds. I tried
(unsuccessfully) to get each high school in which my children were
enrolled to go outside during geometry class and find out how tall
the oak in the yard really is. Instead they buckled under to the
establishment and even removed that staple of my generation: the odd
formulaic Euclidean-style proof in which the pedigree of each step
was detailed. This old game, the one piece of high school
mathematics often mentioned warmly by people who otherwise hated
math, had been found wanting by the mathematical puritans described
in the Stewart quote, where the mathematician is unwilling to "lie a
bit, like everyone else does". I hope the right people read this
essay -- the movers and shakers of school curricula -- and that it
moves them to let a hundred flowers bloom in the classroom."</p>

<title>Definitional and Computational Sum of Squares are equal</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>The definitional (or conceptual) and computational forms of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_sum_of_squares">sum of squared deviations from the mean</a> are equivalent, as in
Equation 1.</p>
<p>\[ SS = \sum \left( x - \overline{x} \right)^2 =
         \sum x^2 - \frac{ \left( \sum x \right)^2 }{ N } \tag{1} \]</p>
<p>We have \( N \) numbers \( x_i \). Their mean is \( \overline{x} \).</p>
<p>\[ \overline{x} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i }{ N }  \tag{2} \]</p>
<p>The limits of every sum here are the same, and always range over the
numbers \( x_i \), so the limits and subscript \( i \) are not
shown outside of Equation 2.</p>
<p>The sum of squared deviations from the mean is defined as in Equation
1.</p>
<p>\[ \sum \left( x - \overline{x} \right)^2 \tag{3} \]</p>
<p>Distributing and rearranging, Expression 3 is the same as Expression
4.</p>
<p>\[ \sum \left( x^2 + \overline{x} \left( \overline{x} - 2x \right) \right) \tag{4} \]</p>
<p>Considering the properties of sums, Expression 4 can be re-written as
Expression 5.</p>
<p>\[ \sum x^2 + \overline{x} \left( \sum \overline{x} -2 \sum x \right) \tag{5} \]</p>
<p>The mean \( \overline{x} \) is a constant, so summing over it gives
\( N \overline{x} \). As can be seen from Equation 2, the sum over
\( x \) is also \( N \overline{x} \). Using these, Expression 5
becomes Expression 6.</p>
<p>\[ \sum x^2 - N \overline{x}^2 \tag{6} \]</p>
<p>Replacing the mean \( \overline{x} \) with its definition as in
Equation 2, we arrive at the computational form.</p>
<p>\[ \sum x^2 - \frac{ \left( \sum x \right)^2 }{ N } \tag{7} \]</p>
<p>Expression 3 and Expression 7 are therefore equal, as shown in
Equation 1. \( \blacksquare \)</p>
<hr>
<p>I thought about writing this up years ago; here's an old
<a href="old.html">draft</a>. I referred to McDowell's <a href="http://psychology.emory.edu/clinical/mcdowell/PSYCH560/Basics/var.html">derivation</a> (nominally
for variance) in writing the above. The computational form is nice
especially if you're calculating by hand, and is (has been?) sometimes
<a href="http://www.ablongman.com/graziano6e/text_site/MATERIAL/Stats/manvar.htm">taught</a> as a procedure, sort of like long division. I don't think
teaching that is really a good idea, if what you care about is
teaching statistics, but it could be a neat example in the right kind
of course on implementation of algorithms (applied math or CS,
maybe?).</p>

<title>AI Superpowers, by Lee</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>There's a lot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai-Fu_Lee">Kai-fu Lee</a> isn't wrong about in <a href="https://www.aisuperpowers.com/">AI Superpowers</a>.
The major break-through of deep learning has occurred, and
applications are now more engineering than invention (cf. <a href="/20200728-technological_revolutions_and_financial_capital/">Perez</a>).
China has data, entrepreneurs, engineers, and government support for
AI. Compared to the US, China has fewer ethical qualms and democratic
controls, which Lee propagandizes as advantages for China. I think
he's right that we should worry more about human society than about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a>, but I think he exaggerates the exceptionalism of AI.</p>
<p>The boundary between AI and non-AI computing isn't clear. There have
been industrial robots for years. Does it matter whether Google search
is powered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)">BERT</a>? It's hard to pin down exactly
what's AI and what isn't. But this isn't my main objection.</p>
<p>There has <em>already been</em> a trend toward concentration of corporate
power, economic inequality, and unemployment/underemployment. The main
problem with Harari's "<a href="https://ideas.ted.com/the-rise-of-the-useless-class/">useless class</a>" idea is his use of the
future tense. The useless class is here already.</p>
<p>It might be better to discuss issues of the future of society in
connections with AI rather than not at all, but I worry that the focus
on AI can distract from trends and approaches that aren't tied to AI.
It isn't useful to make new AI a scapegoat for existing phenomena.</p>
<p>I think Lee overestimates the magnitude of AI's direct impact on jobs,
but maybe not the magnitude of the overall trend in jobs. Regardless,
he then spends the back of the book opining on public policy after his
come-to-Jesus (not literally) experience with cancer. He praises
volunteers and then proposes that we must pay people for things they
would volunteer to do if they didn't have to worry about money. I
don't oppose paying teachers (etc.) more, but I think he's
fundamentally wrong about how humans work, and I think he's way
outside his area of expertise.</p>

<h3>Selected quotes and (rarely) commentary</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"In my view, that [Chinese/US] lead in AI development will translate
into productivity gains on a scale not seen since the Industrial
Revolution." (page 18)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Based on the current trends in technology advancement and adoption,
I predict that within fifteen years, artificial intelligence will
technically be able to replace around 40 to 50 percent of jobs in
the United States. Actual job losses may end up lagging those
technical capabilities by an additional decade, but I forecast that
the disruption to job markets will be very real, very large, and
coming soon." (page 19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Published in 2018, so that's capability by 2033 and job losses by
2043.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The AI world order will combine winner-take-all economics with an
unprecedented concentration of wealth in the hands of a few
companies in China and the United States. This, I believe, is the
real underlying threat posed by artificial intelligence: tremendous
social disorder and political collapse stemming from widespread
unemployment and gaping inequality." (page 21)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Entry into the country's imperial bureaucracy depended on
word-for-word memorization of ancient texts and the ability to
construct a perfect "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-legged_essay">eight-legged essay</a>" following rigid
stylistic guidelines." (page 27)</p>

<p>"But what these critics miss is that this process
[of Chinese central government support] can be both highly
inefficient and extraordinarily effective." (page 65)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"As I laid out earlier, creating an AI superpower for the
twenty-first century requires four main building blocks: abundant
data, tenacious entrepreneurs, well-trained AI scientists, and a
supportive policy environment." (page 82)</p>

<p>"The complete AI revolution will take a little time and will
ultimately wash over us in a series of four waves: internet AI,
business AI, perception AI, and autonomous AI." (page 105)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"And judicial biases can be far less malicious than racism: a study
of Israeli judges found them far more severe in their decision
before lunch and more lenient in granting parole after having a good
meal." (page 116)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if this well-known judge study were replicated and broadly
believed (which it is <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/impossibly-hungry-judges">not</a>), Lee's reference is still rather
appalling excuse-making for racist algorithms.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Chinese and American internet companies have taken different
approaches to winning local markets,
[China supporting local companies, America expanding into markets directly]
and as these AI services filter out to every corner of the world,
they may engage in proxy competition in countries like India,
Indonesia, and parts of the Middle East and Africa." (page 139)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We looked at technical fixes that seek to smooth the transition to
an AI economy: retraining workers, reducing work hours, and
redistributing income through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income">UBI</a>. While all of these
technical fixes have a role to play, I believe something more is
needed. I envision the private sector creatively fostering
human-machine symbiosis, a new wave of impact investing funding
human-centric service jobs, and the government filling the gaps with
a social investment stipend that rewards care, service, and
education." (page 224-225)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In revamping our education systems, we can learn much from South
Korea's embrace of gifted and talented education. These programs

<title>How Not to Be Wrong, by Ellenberg</title>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>I like <a href="https://www.jordanellenberg.com/how-not-to-be-wrong/">this book</a> a lot. The five parts (Linearity, Inference,
Expectation, Regression, Existence) provide beautiful large-scale
structure, and it also shimmers on every page. Supreme Court justices
encounter the word "orthogonal." There's a beautiful proof of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem">Buffon's needle problem</a>. There's some philosophy of math.
Ellenberg is a delight.</p>
<p>In some ways, How Not to Be Wrong is like a long version of
<a href="/20200909-mathematicians_lament_by_lockhart/">Lockhart's exultation</a>, with examples. Lockhart extols the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion">method of exhaustion</a>; Ellenberg teaches it. The author clearly
loves math, and shares it generously with the reader.</p>
<p>The "How Not to Be Wrong" is delivered by exposing numerous common
fallacies or errors in understanding. Not every phenomenon is linear.
"Don't talk about percentages of numbers when the numbers might be
negative." "Improbable things happen a lot," and that affects how you
should think about significance tests and related things. The book is
a joy to read, I'd also read a "handbook" version collecting just the
main ideas.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Selected quotations and (rarely) comments</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Those [homework] integrals are to mathematics as weight training
and calisthenics are to soccer. If you want to play soccer&#8212;I mean,
<em>really play</em>, at a competitive level&#8212;you've got to do a lot of
boring, repetitive, apparently pointless drills." (page 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Math is woven into the way we reason." (page 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Here's an old mathematician's trick that makes the picture
perfectly clear: <em>set some variables to zero</em>." (pages 6-7)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"What assumptions are you making? And are they justified?" (page 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mathematics <em>is</em> common sense." (page 10)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mathematicians like to give names to the phenomena our common sense
describes: instead of saying &#8220;<em>This</em> thing added to <em>that</em> thing is
the <em>same</em> thing as <em>that</em> thing added to <em>this</em> thing,&#8221; we say
&#8220;Addition is commutative.&#8221;" (page 11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a philosophy similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Mathematics_Comes_From">Where Mathematics Comes From</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"We tend to teach mathematics as a long list of rules. You learn
them in order and you have to obey them, because if you don&#8217;t obey
them you get a C-. <em>This is not mathematics.</em> Mathematics is the
study of things that come out a certain way because there is no
other way they could possibly be." (page 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The specialized language in which mathematicians converse with one
another is a magnificent tool for conveying complex ideas precisely
and swiftly. But its foreignness can create among outsiders the
impression of a sphere of thought totally alien to ordinary
thinking. That's exactly wrong." (page 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mathematics is the extension of common sense by other means." (page
13)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"School mathematics is largely made up of a sequence of facts and
rules, facts which are certain, rules which come from a higher
authority and cannot be questioned." (page 14)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mathematics is not settled." (page 14)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"(Aside: it's important to point out here that people with
out-of-the-mainstream ideas who compare themselves to Edison and
Galileo are <em>never actually right</em>. I get letters with this kind of
language at least once a month, usually from people who have
&#8220;proofs&#8221; of mathematical statements that have been known for
hundreds of years to be false. I can guarantee you Einstein did not
go around telling people, &#8220;Look, I know this theory of general
relativity sounds wacky, but that's what they said about Galileo!&#8221;)"

<blockquote>
<p>"Working an integral or performing a linear regression is something
a computer can do quite effectively. Understanding whether the
result makes sense&#8212;or deciding whether the method is the right one
to use in the first place&#8212;requires a guiding human hand. When we
teach mathematics we are supposed to be explaining how to be that
guide. A math course that fails to do so is essentially training the
student to be a very slow, buggy version of Microsoft Excel." (page
56)</p>

<p>"there are algorithms I think we can safely discard in the modern
world. We don't need to teach students how to extract square roots

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Of course it's no better (in fact, it's substantially worse) to
pass along a population of students who've developed some wispy
sense of mathematical meaning but can't work examples swiftly and
correctly. A math teacher's least favorite thing to hear from a
student is &#8220;I get the concept, but I couldn't do the problems.&#8221;
Though the student doesn't know it, this is shorthand for &#8220;I don't
get the concept.&#8221; The ideas of mathematics can sound abstract, but
they make sense only in reference to concrete computations. William
Carlos Williams put it crisply: <em>no ideas but in things</em>." (page 58)</p>

<p>"If a tiny state like South Dakota experiences a rash of brain
cancer, you might presume that the spike is in large measure due to

future is likely to be closer to the overall national number. You
could accomplish this by taking some kind of weighted average of the
South Dakota rate with the national rate. But how to weight the two
numbers? That's a bit of an art, involving a fair amount of
technical labor I'll spare you here." (pages 70-71)</p>

<p>Ellenberg says "inference" but I might say "abduction."</p>
<hr>
<p>Dangers of comparing very small rates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... <em>twice a tiny number is a tiny number</em>. How good or bad it is
to double something depends on how big that something is!" (page

<p>"If only we could go back in time to the dawn of statistical
nomenclature and declare that a result passing Fisher's test with a
p-value of less than 0.05 was &#8220;statistically noticeable&#8221; or
&#8220;statistically detectable&#8221; instead of &#8220;statistically significant&#8221;!
That would be truer to the meaning of the method, which merely
counsels us about the existence of an effect but is silent about its
size or importance. But it's too late for that. We have the language
we have." (page 121)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"It has come to my attention that hardly anybody knows what the
logarithm is. Let me take a step toward fixing this. The logarithm
of a positive number <em>N</em>, called <em>log N</em>, is the number of digits it

<p>He goes on to call this the "fake logarithm," of "flogarithm."</p>

<p>"The p-value is the answer to the question</p>
<p>""The chance that the observed experimental result would occur,
given that the null hypothesis is correct."</p>
<p>"But what we <em>want</em> to know is the other conditional probability:</p>
<p>""The chance that the null hypothesis is correct, given that we
observed a certain experimental result."" (page 170)</p>

<p>This is connected to Bayesian stats as "inverse probability", and he
also notes that it's referred to as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor%27s_fallacy">the prosecutor's fallacy</a>" and
references the book <em>Math on Trial</em>.</p>

<p>Saying that even Fisher thinks our prior beliefs enter our work;
Fisher just has certain ideas about when it's appropriate to invoke
probability: he insists on some actual chance process.</p>

theories that rest on analogies to things we already know about

<p>"... you have to be careful about the universe of theories you
consider. Just as there may be more than one solution to a quadratic

lead us badly astray." (page 185)</p>

money back and then some." (page 209)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gets at what I think is important: It isn't the expected value
you care about, it's your probability of being in a state that doesn't
suck. You want P(losing money) to become negligible, and that can
happen if you have positive expected value <em>and</em> enough tickets.</p>

<p>The doctrine of expected utility is appealingly straightforward and
simple: presented with a set of choices, pick the one with the
highest expected utility. It is perhaps the closest thing we have to
a simple mathematical theory of individual decision making. And it
captures many features of the way humans make choices, which is why
it remains a central part of the quantitative social scientist's
tool kit. (page 248)</p>

<p>"In the decision-theory literature, the former kind of unknown is
called <em>risk</em>, the latter <em>uncertainty</em>." (page 251)</p>

<p>The former is known unknowns (30% chance of drawing a black ball) and
the latter is unknown unknowns (maybe we're wrong about what the
chance is).</p>

<p>"The Patent Department would not release the thing until they had
patent coverage. ... I didn't believe that they could patent a bunch
of mathematical formulas. I said they couldn't. They said, "Watch
us." They were right. And since then I have known that I have a very
weak understanding of patent laws because, regularly, things that
you shouldn't be able to patent&#8211;it's outrageous&#8211;you can patent."

eminently important difference." (page 300, quoting Charles Darwin's
letter to his cousin Francis Galton on the effect of reading
Galton's "Hereditary Genius")</p>

<hr>
<p>Ellenberg includes a fun table of Galton's on page 316, which has the
character of a visualization in that you can see an ellipse, sort of
like a two-dimensional stem and leaf plot...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_anthropometry#Forensic_anthropometry">Bertillonage</a> (page 325) is kind of interesting and can be related

analyze some questions mathematically, we acquire a general
confidence in our beliefs, which extends unjustifiably to those

<blockquote>
<p>"Darwin showed that one could meaningfully talk about progress
without any need to invoke purpose. Galton showed that one could
meaningfully talk about association without any need to invoke

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mathematicians ever since Descartes have enjoyed the wonderful
freedom to flip back and forth between algebraic and geometric
descriptions of the world. The advantage of algebra is that it's
easier to formalize and to type into a computer. The advantage of
geometry is that it allows us to bring our physical intuition to
bear on the situation, particularly when you can draw a picture. I
seldom feel I <em>really</em> understand a piece of mathematics until I
know what it's about in geometric language." (page 336)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This relates to "The Rule of Three" in the McCallum et al. <em>Multivariable Calculus</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Every topic should be presented geometrically, numerically and
algebraically." (page v)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"It may sound impressive that we can do geometry in ten dimensions
(or a hundred, or a million...), but the mental pictures we keep in
our mind are two- or at most three-dimensional. That's all our
brains can handle. Fortunately, this impoverished vision is usually
enough." (page 338)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"... a mathematical tool that's just right for one purpose tends to
make itself useful again and again." (page 340)</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Correlation is not transitive. It's more like "blood relation"&#8211;I'm
related to my son, who's related to my wife, but my wife and I
aren't blood relatives to each other. In fact, it's not a terrible
idea to think of correlated variables as "sharing part of their
DNA."" (page 342)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"Undecided voters, by and large, aren't undecided because they're
carefully weighing the merits of each candidate, unprejudiced by
political dogma. They're undecided because they're barely paying
attention." (page 346)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>A section titled "It's not always wrong to be wrong" on page 354
suggests decision-making by expected value can be appropriate even if
it turns out later that a risk isn't as previously believed.</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"The "majority rules" system is simple and elegant and feels fair,
but it's at its best when deciding between just two options. Any
more than two, and contradictions start to seep into the majority's
preferences." (page 368)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ellenberg's immediate (and real, October 2010) example:</p>
<ul>
<li>52% oppose ACA</li>
<li>41% support ACA</li>
</ul>
<p>But:</p>
<ul>
<li>37% favor repeal of ACA</li>
<li>10% favor weakening ACA</li>
<li>15% favor maintaining ACA</li>
<li>36% favor expanding ACA</li>
</ul>
<p>This implies that some of the "oppose" people oppose it because they
want <em>more extreme</em> policy than ACA, not less.</p>

the poll's options, to see whether it might break down into
different-colored pieces." (page 368)</p>

<p>"For most people, nowadays, the appeal of democratic choice is that

grounds that people should be able to choose their own rulers,

</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is a story told in mathematics again and again: we develop a
method that works for one problem, and if it is a <em>good</em> method, one
that really contains a new idea, we typically find that the same
proof works in many different contexts, which may be as different
from the original as a sphere is from a plane, or more so." (page

<p>Describes formalism as being the tradition of definition; thinking
about what "1 - 1 + 1 -1 + ..." should be <em>defined as</em>, rather that
what it <em>is</em>. This can have the effect of replacing <em>meaning</em> with
definition.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>"If we're to be precise, Russell was not a formalist, like Hilbert,
who declared that the axioms were just strings of symbols with no
defined meaning; rather, he was a "logicist," whose view was that
the axioms were actually true statements about logical facts. Both
groups shared a vigorous interest in figuring out which statements
could be deduced from the axioms. The extent to which you care about
this distinction is a good measure of whether you would enjoy going
to graduate school in analytic philosophy." (page 409)</p>

<p>"Political logic is not a formal system in the sense that Hilbert
and the mathematical logicians meant, but mathematicians with a
formalist outlook couldn't help but approach politics with the same
kind of methodological sympathies. They were encouraged in this by
Hilbert himself, who in his 1918 lecture "<a href="/20200923-axiomatic_thinking_hilbert_1918/">Axiomatic Thought</a>"
advocated that the other sciences adopt the axiomatic approach that
had been so successful in mathematics."</p>

<p>"[F. Scott Fitzgerald's] endorsement of holding contradictory
beliefs ["the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to
hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still
